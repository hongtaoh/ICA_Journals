Interviews with romantic couples resulted in three themes: rules are performative, rules reduce conflict, and rules guide modality weaving. During an expectation violation, findings revealed that the magnitude of the violation is first determined by the violator defending their behavior. Then, based on the appraisal process, the couple reframes the rule to better work for their future interactions. Key findings conclude that rules are not rigid; they are fluid and develop naturally over time. This research adds to the literature about how mediated communication transforms the dynamics of romantic relationships as couples explicitly and implicitly create communication rules to help maintain their partnership.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmac007

This article reports on the development and validation of two measures that categorize the types of emails employees send/receive into two different constructs based on the perceived importance and importance and urgency. The measures were developed using Buss and Craik’s Act Frequency Approach. Analysis determined that our six-item important email and our eight-item important and urgent email scales were both reliable and valid measures of the constructs. Construct validity was demonstrated by embedding our measures in a nomological network linking email demands to employee well-being. The measures were found to be significant predictors of work-role overload, even when the more traditional measures used to quantify the demands imposed on employees by email were taken into account.

Lay Summary

This article presents two scales that can be used to measure the extent to which an employee perceives an email to be: (a) important and (b) both important and urgent. As expected by theory, both measures were found to predict employees’ feelings of being overloaded by their work. The interesting findings from this study are the following. First, employees seem to consider urgent emails to be important, perhaps without consideration to the email’s actual importance to the employee. Second, emails that are both important and urgent usually involve a key stakeholder being impacted if the email is not acted on quickly. Third, important emails are not necessarily considered urgent. To make an email urgent the sender has to explicitly state how the contents of the email will negatively impact key stakeholders. Finally, our findings suggest that reducing the volume of email someone has to process may not, on its own, lead to reduced employee stress. Rather, employers who seek to improve employee well-being should focus their efforts on reducing the volume of emails employees consider to be important and both important and urgent.",3,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmac001

In this article, we present a conceptual framework for studying the communication of values on and through social media composed of two dimensions: scale (from individual users to global infrastructures) and explicitness (from the most explicit to the invisible). Utilizing the model, we compare the communication of two values—engagement and authenticity—in user-generated content and policy documents on Twitter and Instagram. We find a split between how users and platforms frame these concepts and discuss the strategic role of ambiguity in value discourse, where idealistic meanings invoked by users positively charge the instrumental applications stressed by platforms. We also show how implicit and explicit articulations of the same value can contradict each other. Finally, we reflect upon tensions within the model, as well as the power relations between the personal, cultural, and infrastructural levels of platform values.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtab008

We thus consider the success of populism as neither inherently driven by political leaders nor primarily driven by increasing populist attitudes in the public and acknowledge the fragmented nature of the populist discourse emphasized by recent studies. We raise the question of whether there is a populist collective identity, which is accountable in terms of populist rhetorical elements, and how it changes over time. To answer this question, we apply the proposed framework to the case of the rise and development of the populist discourse in Switzerland while accounting for its dynamic adaptation to raising public concerns and for the influence of its core rhetorical elements on individual voting behavior.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtab003

This essay focuses on algorithms and organizing by reviewing the literature on algorithms in organizations, examining the viewpoint of relationality and relational agency on algorithms and organizing, exploring the properties of algorithms, and concluding what these mean from an organizational communication viewpoint. Algorithms need data to be collected. The data are always biased, and algorithms exclude everything that is not in their code. They define what is seen as important. Their operating principles are opaque, and they are political due to human interference. Algorithms are not just used. Rather, they are co-actors in organizing. We argue that algorithms demand rethinking communication in the communicative constitution of organizations and call for more empirical research emphasizing the properties of algorithms, the relationality of algorithms, and the temporality of the materialization of algorithms.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/hcr/hqac013

Over 7 days, 250 participants reported their social interactions and lies across face-to-face communication, social media, texting, the phone, video chat, and email. Replicating Hancock, Thom-Santelli, and Ritchie (2004), people told the most lies per social interaction over synchronous, distributed, and recordless media (the phone, video chat), though the effects were small and between-person effects explained more variance than between-media effects.

These effects shrink substantially but remain significant for panel studies. While we found a stronger relationship with knowledge for experiments compared to surveys, the relationship between IE and discussion and participation was not significant for experiments.

The second experiment tested whether exposure to civil and uncivil previous user comments influenced the civility of participants’ comments. Humor was found to reduce online incivility by reducing feelings of anger and increasing liking towards the author in both experiments.

Applying the “im/mobilities” framework, this study explains how different left-behind caregivers use mediated communication as communicative mobilities to negotiate family roles and relationships in situated transnational power geometry. Despite the common structural constraints (rural patriarchy and inadequate social resources), left-behind women’s socio-structural immobilities vary depending on their specific relationship with migrants (conjugal, kinship, and intergenerational dynamics), which embodies the asymmetrical nature of transnationalism. The findings highlight the dynamic negotiation between left-behind caregivers’ communicative mobilities and their contextualized socio-structural immobilities, which leads to diverse forms of agency and disempowerment. This article shows that communicative mobility is not only manifested as media use but also embodied as media (non)use.

Transnational labor migration has allowed people in poor areas to improve their financial well-being, but has also caused separations among many families. Thanks to the prevalence of various digital media (e.g., instant messaging, webcam and voice calls, and social media platforms, etc.), fragmented family members are able to maintain and manage different family relationships despite geographic constraints. This study draws on three groups of female caregivers (mothers, aunts, and grandmothers) in Fuqing, a major transnational migrant-labor-sending area in China. I am particularly interested in how these left-behind women collaborate with migrant parents to fulfil their duties of raising left-behind children through digital media. The findings suggest that left-behind women’s life experiences are not only related to gender norms and inadequate social resources (e.g., a lack of job opportunities and robust social welfare system) in rural China, but also pertinent to their specific relationship with migrants (e.g., conjugal, kinship, and intergenerational dynamics). While female caregivers’ different situations influence their media practices during childrearing collaboration with migrant parents, such media engagement also contributes to the shaping of their transnational family relationships.",3,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmac003

As people tend to connect with like-minded others and express opinions in response to current events on social media, social media public opinion is naturally occurring, temporally sensitive, and inherently social. Our framework for measuring social media public opinion first samples targeted nodes from a large social graph and identifies homogeneous, interactive, and stable networks of actors, which we call “flocks,” based on social network structure, and then measures and presents opinions of flocks. We apply this framework to Twitter and provide empirical evidence for flocks being meaningful units of analysis and flock membership predicting opinion expression. Through contextualizing social media public opinion by foregrounding the various homogeneous networks it is embedded in, we highlight the need to go beyond the aggregate-level measurement of social media public opinion and study the social dynamics of opinion expression using social media.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmab021

Growing empirical evidence points to the obstacles this poses for trans and non-binary individuals in several spheres, including border security, healthcare, and social media. Drawing on autoethnographic vignettes, semi-structured interviews, and survey responses, we look to the increased use of binary-based biometric technologies and automatic gender recognition (AGR), which rely on outmoded understandings of gender as static, measurable, and physiological.

It compared emotional support from chatbot versus human partners in terms of its process and conditional effects on stress/worry reduction. In an online experiment, participants discussed a personal stressor with a chatbot or a human partner who provided none, or either one or both of emotional support and reciprocal self-disclosure. The results showed that emotional support from a conversational partner was mediated through perceived supportiveness of the partner to reduce stress and worry among participants, and the link from emotional support to perceived supportiveness was stronger for a human than for a chatbot. A conversational partner’s reciprocal self-disclosure enhanced the positive effect of emotional support on worry reduction. However, when emotional support was absent, a solely self-disclosing chatbot reduced even less stress than a chatbot not providing any response to participants’ stress.

In recent years, AI chatbots have increasingly been used to provide empathy and support to people who are experiencing stressful times. This study compared emotional support from a chatbot compared to that of a human who provided support. We were interested in examining which approach could best effectively reduce people’s worry and stress. When either a person or a chatbot was able to engage with a stressed individual and tell that individual about their own experiences, they were able to build rapport. We found that this type of reciprocal self-disclosure was effective in calming the worry of the individual. Interestingly, if a chatbot only reciprocally self-disclosed but offered no emotional support, the outcome was worse than if the chatbot did not respond to people at all.

To the extent that a politically knowledgeable electorate is necessary for a thriving democracy, understanding the mechanisms underlying the extent to which political comedy facilitates or inhibits a well-informed citizenry is critical. Across two studies, we use behavioral experiments and neuroimaging to examine the causal effects of humor on the desire to share and the capacity to remember political information. We find that humor increases the likelihood to share political information with others and enhances people’s memory for information. Humor also increases brain response in regions associated with understanding other people’s mental states (i.e., mentalizing), which advances a theoretical framework that humor may facilitate considerations of others’ views (e.g., how other people will respond to shared political information).",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqaa041

As an alternative, interpersonal communication is the primary mechanism by which to ensure social media privacy. Finally, trust and norms function as mechanisms that represent crystallized privacy communication. Further materials are available at https://osf.io/xhqjy/",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtz035

We argue that this conception of value creates theoretical blind spots for other types of value that derive from other processes besides competent use, such as the exchange and acquisition of communication resources. Drawing on recent anthropological scholarship and our own cross-cultural comparative case study of United States and Chinese students' accounts of learning Anglo-American public speaking, we claim that, from an ethnographic perspective, a communication resource has value insofar as speakers interpret it as an object of desire due to its function as a means to other valued entities or focal values in the context of relevant social processes.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtz042

Since interest groups differ from other public communicators, we propose a theory of interest group persuasion. Interest groups typically have a low public profile, and so most people are unlikely to have strong attitudes regarding them. Source-related predispositions, such as credibility assessments, are therefore less relevant in moderating effects of persuasive appeals by interest groups than those of high-profile communicators. We test this argument in multiple large-scale studies. A parallel survey and field experiment (N = 4,659) establishes the persuasive potential of low-profile interest groups in both controlled and realistic settings. An observational study (N = 700) shows that substantial portions of the public are unable to assess interest group credibility. A survey experiment (N = 8,245) demonstrates that credibility assessments moderate the impact of party but not interest group communication.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqab005

We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

In the era of unprecedented political divides and misinformation, artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms are often seen as the culprits. In contrast to these dominant narratives, we argued that AI might be seen as being less biased than a human in online political contexts. We relied on six preregistered experiments in three countries (the United Sates, Spain, Poland) to test whether internet users perceive AI and AI-assisted humans more favorably than simply humans; (a) across various distinct scenarios online, and (b) when exposing people to opposing political information on a range of contentious issues.

Mass media themselves—the print press, television, radio, books, as well as the Internet and social media—and especially the contents they produce and widely disseminate, have been the topics of diverse studies anchored in many disciplines. It appears, however, that one such medium has failed to attract the research attention it deserves and has even failed to be recognized as a mass medium. This medium is postage stamps, with billions of copies printed annually and disseminated worldwide. In 2009, 37 billion stamps were printed in the United States alone (Ballentine, 2016). This article proposes to define postage stamps as a mass medium, based on generally accepted definitions and well-known communication theories. Postage stamps constitute official state documents that reflect the values that a country wishes to represent to its citizens and the world. Embracing the definition of postage stamps as a mass medium would, among other things, extend the research horizons of fields such as media, politics, arts, and culture.

Relying on an online panel survey conducted in the United States (N = 1,493), we examine the relationship between three indicators of respondents’ attention centrality (closeness, betweenness, and reach) and the partisan valence of their news selections.

By engaging with affect, we can recuperate potential eclipsed by this contrast and cultivate communication theory that: (a) informs transmission as a constitutive activity, (b) expands what counts as communication beyond human language and social interaction, and (c) recovers disappeared ways that power operates communicatively. Retuning communication in this way, we can inform what remains enigmatic in affect theory: how communicability happens.

To examine the emergence and consequences of perceived incivility in disagreement comments, the present study reports on two population-based online survey experiments in Hong Kong (N1 = 1,207, N2 = 611). The results indicate that individuals perceive a higher degree of incivility in disagreement comments directed to in-group members than in those directed to out-group members, regardless of content features. This bias perception is greater when respondents can easily identify the incivility in a comment. Furthermore, exposure to disagreement comments can only influence willingness to participate and affective polarization indirectly via perceived incivility, and such effects are conditional on whether respondents can easily identify the incivility in a comment.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqab008

Intersubject correlations of brain activity during message exposure showed that listening to personal narratives elicited strong audience engagement as evidenced by robust correlations across participants’ frontal and parietal lobes compared to a nonpersonal control text and a reversed language control stimulus.

This subjective feeling of not being part of rewarding experiences others are having can decrease adolescents’ social well-being in the long term. In this study, we examined whether supportive communication with their parents about digital media use might protect early adolescents from these negative effects. To that aim, we conducted a longitudinal survey of 384 early adolescents between 10 and 14 years at two time points over a period of 4 months. Findings showed that adolescents who have little supportive interaction with their parents about digital media use were more likely to experience the FoMO. As assumed, this resulted in lower social well-being over time. In sum, the results suggest that supportive communication with parents may protect early adolescents from potential negative consequences of following social media influencers.

We make this argument by reviewing how three dominant traditions of mediatization scholarship: (a) institutionalist, (b) cultural/social constructivist, and (c) materialist conceptualize “the environment.” We argue that scholars rarely acknowledge the materialist dimension of mediatization despite it being a fundamental aspect of mediatization processes. Consequently, we bring discourse surrounding the materiality of mediatization to the fore by drawing on theories of materiality from media and communication studies in general and highlighting three material dimensions of mediatization processes in particular: (a) resources, (b) energy, and (c) waste.

The case study combines the analysis of personal interviews and zine content with an ethnography of the production and distribution processes, including zine fairs.

This article proposes a descriptive theory of behavioral crisis communication that uses principles of behavioral economics to explain the recurrence of suboptimal anomalies found in crisis communication. Based on decision-making literature we first argue that the distinct context in which crisis communication takes place (e.g., time pressure, information overload) determines whether or not decisions are made in an analytical or an intuitive manner. Behavioral economics further allows us to explain how intuitive decisions can sometimes be biased by heuristics, which can result in the choice for a suboptimal crisis response strategy in the heat of the moment.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtz002

This study investigates the effects of violence, interactivity, and player skill on mild aggressive behavior using a custom-developed first-person shooter game allowing for high levels of experimental control. We conduct effect and equivalence tests with effect size assumptions drawn from prominent meta-analyses in the video game violence literature, finding that aggressive behavior following violent video game play is statistically equivalent to that observed following non-violent game play. We also observe an interaction between violent game content, player skill, and interactivity. When player skill matched the interactivity of the game, violent content led to an increase in aggressive behavior, whereas when player skill did not match the interactivity of the game, violent content decreased aggressive behavior.

These results highlight how a medium’s gendered construction may not be salient to consumers, who carefully navigate divides between their own and industrially designed identities, but can simultaneously reaffirm existing power structures.

Additional moderator analyses took into account study design, sample population, and quality of the studies. Results highlight reciprocal longitudinal effects among CP, CV, and both traditional bullying and victimization: CP causes externalizing problem behaviors over time, whereas CV constitutes a risk factor of internalizing problems, such as depression and anxiety. Conversely, behavioral problems and increased Internet use predict involvement in CP, while depression, anxiety, and Internet use also predict CV over time.

However, prior research has largely neglected that upward comparisons on SNS may also facilitate positive outcomes, specifically media-induced inspiration, a motivational state highly conducive to well-being. We conducted two experiments that tested whether and how cognitive-affective processing of visual SNS postings results in inspiration. Study 1 (N = 270) provides first evidence that users react to more positive, optimized Instagram nature and travel posts with stronger upward comparison, which facilitates inspiration via an assimilative emotional reaction (benign envy), thus enhancing well-being. The preregistered Study 2 (N = 408) replicates these findings. Overall, results indicate that users can be inspired from comparing upwards on SNS, which may briefly improve their well-being.

The violence of the ambiguous third party, in the first instance, produces a phatic exigency through which bonds might be created or sustained. Any subsequent communion (or its denial) with a group is the result of a mediated ritual process, one that is structured by and regenerates the bonds of antipathy that define the war on terror.

Four such positions are identified and appraised, namely the visual citizen as: (a) news observer and circulator, (b) accidental news image-maker and contributor, (c) purposeful news image-maker and activist, and (d) creative image-maker and news commentator. Evaluating these positions in relation to their significance for visual journalism, this article aims to advance efforts to rethink the inscription of imagery in news reportage and its import for public life.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtz028

Conversely, the public’s perception of the media as being generally hostile and biased in their reporting could make a journalist’s allegation of evasion enhance the politician’s credibility. We constructed political TV interviews in which a journalist falsely accused a politician of evasiveness. Consistent with serial multiple mediation as proposed by TDT, in Study 1 (N = 210 U.S. voters) a journalist’s allegation triggered suspicion, which increased perceived dodging, resulting in voters distrusting the politician. Absent a journalist’s allegation, however, people remained in their truth-default state toward the politician.

Drawing in part on Rebecca Wanzo’s consideration of “precarious-girl comedy” (2016) I examine how two British television comedies intensified these intimate connections through the use of direct address, binding the audience tightly to the sexual and social misadventures of their twenty-something female protagonists. Michaela Coel’s Chewing Gum (E4, 2015–2017) follows naïve and desperately horny black working-class Londoner Tracey in her quest for sexual experience, and Phoebe-Waller Bridges’ Fleabag (BBC Three, 2016–) documents an unnamed upper-middle-class white woman’s sharply misanthropic journey through grief. In both programmes direct address serves to intensify the embrace of bodily affect and intimate access to interiority found in the “precarious-girl comedy” (Wanzo, 2016), producing moments of comic and emotional repulsion. Each program uses direct address’s blend of directness and distance to different ends, but both draw audiences at times uncomfortably close to the singular perspective of their protagonists, creating an intensely affective comic intimacy.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ccc/tcz014

Developing this insight, I suggest a specifically communicative theory of media materialism that is concerned with the ontological being of media objects, including their physical properties, but that does not abandon these objects’ deeply social elements.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qty034

Construal level theory can guide new hypotheses that test the persuasiveness of certain combinations of message features and tailoring messages to different individual orientations. This is possible as the theory may reveal underlying similarities across disparate message topics, design elements, and message processing styles. Core principles of construal level theory are explicated, and message effects research areas that may benefit from its propositions are reviewed and elaborated upon.

Drawing on Bourdieu, we argue that these distinct responses are shaped in part by a journalist’s position in the field: those in low positions tend to endure; those in intermediate positions generally invest; and those in high positions are likely to ignore. We also suggest that the meanings of these responses vary according to the distinctive fields in which journalists are embedded, with the reactions of Toulouse journalists generally less market-oriented than their Seattle counterparts.

We advance a case for a critical media analysis that will take seriously the affective and psychic life of neoliberalism as an increasingly central means of governing and producing people’s desires, attachments, and modes of “getting by.” To illustrate our broader theoretical argument, we will discuss the contradictory neoliberal regulation of affective dispositions for women, which prescribe confidence or alternatively, the pleasing, lighthearted readiness to “not take the self too seriously.” We make a case for expanding our theoretical and conceptual vocabulary in order to foreground the relationship between neoliberalism, media and subjectivity in the maintenance of continuing inequalities.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqy002

We manipulated burden by having participants recall (Study 2) or, in Studies 1 and 3, read and think about a Facebook friend who was burdensome, neutral, or rewarding. When recalling or thinking about a burdensome, compared to rewarding or neutral, Facebook friend, participants self-reported more pain, increased negative affect, and indicated they would do more exclusionary Facebook behaviors. Moreover, physical and affective components of self-reported pain mediated the relation between burden and exclusionary behavior.

We analyzed 66 studies, representing 78,643 participants, and found that the disaster media effects literature is built upon the theory of psychological trauma, that the role of uncertainty and social aspects of disaster media effects are understudied, and that transactional disaster media effect studies are nonexistent. Our analysis also indicates that adding a contextual category to the DSMM model is beneficial in synthesizing media effects. Opportunities for future research are discussed.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqy023

To this task, this article moves beyond the semantics toward a systematic analysis and comparison of the logics guiding charismatic and celebrity dynamics. I argue that charisma and celebrity represent distinct and even partly contradictory logics of social distinction, but that they nonetheless substantially intertwine and coextend in society, which renders their interaction ambiguous, conflictual, and creative of new social forms. This social-ontological conceptualization provides the now-lacking theoretical foundation for empirical studies into the many complex interactions between charismatic and celebrity dynamics throughout society.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/comt.12120

From a theoretical perspective, these findings cast political talk as a more complex phenomenon than what deliberative theory suggests, and point to social motivations as an additional path to civic life.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/hcre.12086

Racial performances limit the rhetorical agency of marginalized groups in two ways: They reduce racial identity to a mere accessory and they frame racial interaction as a short-lived tourist encounter. Treating race as an accessory equates Black and White bodies, creating an illusion of equality, while fashion tourism reduces race to spectacle at the expense of the voices of marginalized groups. Racechange in high fashion thus functions as part of a postracial “common sense” that limits the rhetorical agency of persons of color.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/cccr.12037

L'autonomie par la caution? Le sens polysémique des publicités de Dove créées par les utilisatrices

Brooke Erin Duffy

Bien que les campagnes de marketing générées par l'utilisateur aient été citées comme preuves du «nouveau consommateur autonome», d'autres ont souligné leur nature exploitante. Ce débat se complique lorsqu'il est mis en dialogue avec une rhétorique féministe d'autonomisation, comme celle soutenant un récent concours de publicités créées par les consommatrices pour l'entreprise Dove. À travers des entretiens, des analyses et des observations, cet article étudie la façon dont les enjeux de pouvoir, de travail et de loisir s'articulaient pour divers participants au concours. La créativité, l'authenticité et l'autonomisation émergent des données comme étant des thèmes convergeants et divergeants. C'est précisément en raison de la nature polysémique de ces thèmes que le concours fut en mesure de tout à la fois appuyer le produit, exploiter le travail des participants et donner aux consommatrices un sentiment de pouvoir en tant que personnes, en tant que femmes et en tant que professionnelles créatrices.

Empowerment durch Bestätigung? Polysemische Bedeutung in der nutzergenerierten Werbung von Dove

Brooke Erin Duffy

Im Kontext des digitalen Zeitalters der Massenkommunikation, löst sich die einstige Trennung zwischen Medienproduktion und Konsum anscheinend auf, und an dieser Stelle entsteht eine Kultur der Interaktivität. Konsumenten nehmen nicht nur mehr an der Produktion von Nachrichten und Unterhaltung teil, sie werden auch aktiv in kommerzielle Initiativen einbezogen. Auch wenn einige nutzergenerierte Marketing-Kampagnen als Beweis für den „empowerten Konsumenten“ anführen, betonen andere den ausbeuterischen Charakter dieses Produktionsprozesses. Diese Ausbeutungs-Empowerment-Debatte wird zudem durch die Verknüpfung mit der feministischen Rhetorik von Empowerment verkompliziert, welche durch den aktuellen nutzergenerierten Werbewettbewerb von Dove verdeutlicht wird. In diesem Artikel untersuche ich mittels Interviews, Diskursanalyse und teilnehmender Online-Beobachtung, wie Aspekte von Macht, Arbeit und Freizeit von verschiedenen Wettbewerbsteilnehmern artikuliert wurden – Dove-Geschäftsführer, Amateur-Werbeproduzenten und Online-Publikum. Aus den Daten ergeben sich Themen wie Kreativität, Authentizität und Empowerment, welche auf verschiedene Art und Weise zusammenhängen und divergieren. Genauer gesagt, lag es an der polysemischen Natur dieser Themen, dass es mit diesem Wettbewerb möglich war, zugleich das Produkt zu stützen, die Arbeit der Teilnehmer auszunutzen und den Konsumenten ein Gefühl von Macht als Individuen, Frauen und kreative Professionelle zu geben.

Resumen

Aunque algunos han citado las campañas de mercadotecnia generadas por el usuario como evidencia del “nuevo fortalecimiento del poder del consumidor,” otros han enfatizado su naturaleza explotadora. Este debate se hace más complicado cuando es traído dentro del diálogo de una retórica feminista de fortalecimiento del poder, tal que apuntala una competencia reciente de un aviso publicitario de Dove generado por el usuario. Este artículo examina cómo estos asuntos de poder, trabajo, y placer, fueron articulados entre varios participantes de la competencia a través de entrevistas, análisis, y observación. Emergiendo de los datos son temas de creatividad, autenticidad, y fortalecimiento del poder que converge y diverge. Es precisamente a raíz de la naturaleza polisémica de estos temas que la competencia fue capaz de avalar simultáneamente el producto, explotar el trabajo del participante, y dar a los consumidores un sentido de poder como individuos, como mujeres, y como profesionales creativos.",14,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1753-9137.2009.01056.x

Cette étude explore l’effet des images médiatiques et de la race sur l’attribution d’une responsabilité quant aux conséquences de l’ouragan Katrina. Les participants, Noirs et Blancs, ont lu la même nouvelle concernant l’ouragan et ses suites, l’histoire ayant été manipulée pour inclure des images de victimes blanches, des images de victimes noires ou aucune image du tout. On a ensuite demandé aux participants de dire qui était selon eux responsable du désastre humanitaire ayant suivi la tempête. Les répondants blancs ont exprimé moins d’impressions de responsabilité gouvernementale lorsque l’histoire incluait des photos de victimes. Cet effet n’est pas apparu chez les participants noirs. Les images n’ont pas eu d’effets sur l’attribution de responsabilité aux résidents de la Nouvelle-Orléans.

Diese Studie betrachtet die Wirkung von Nachrichtenbildern und Rasse auf die Zuschreibung von Verantwortlichkeit für die Konsequenzen von Hurrikan Katrina. Die Teilnehmer schwarzer und weißer Hautfarbe lasen die gleichen Nachrichten über den Hurrikan und dessen Folgen. Die Bilder zeigten entweder weiße Opfer, schwarze Opfer oder es wurde auf eine Bebilderung verzichtet. Die Teilnehmer wurden dann gefragt, wen sie für die humanitäre Katastrophe nach dem Sturm verantwortlich machten. Weiße Teilnehmer zogen die Regierung weniger in die Verantwortung, wenn Bilder von Opfern gezeigt wurden. Für schwarze Teilnehmer zeigte sich dieser Effekt nicht. Die Bilder beeinflussten nicht die Zuschreibung von Verantwortlichkeit auf die Einwohner von New Orleans selbst. Diese Ergebnisse werden im Sinne der Annahmen der Framing-Theorie interpretiert, bei denen Bilder als episodische Framing-Mechanismen dienen.

To fill this gap, spatial presence is conceptualized here as a cognitive feeling. From this perspective, spatial presence is a feedback from unconscious cognitive processes that informs conscious thought about the state of the spatial cognitive system. Current theorizing on the origins and properties of cognitive feelings is reviewed and applied to spatial presence. This new conception of presence draws attention to the functionality of spatial presence for judgments, decisions, and behavior. By highlighting the distinction between spatial cognitive processes and the subjective feeling of spatial presence, the use of questionnaires is theoretically grounded and legitimized as a method of presence research.

This article extends this line of theorizing about the role of political conversation in citizen competence by testing an O-S-R-O-R model of campaign communication mediation, a modification and extension of the longstanding O-S-O-R model of communication effects. This model combines insights from iterations of the communication mediation model (McLeod et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2007) and cognitive mediation model (Eveland, 2001; Eveland, Shah, & Kwak, 2003) to theorize a set of the interrelated reasoning (R) processes that channel the influences of campaign exposure and news consumption on political engagement. Three key mediators of campaign and news influence are postulated: face-to-face political conversation, online political messaging, and cognitive reflection. We provide empirical evidence to test this model by merging two datasets: (1) tracking of the content and placement of campaign messages in the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, and (2) surveys of traditional and digital media consumption and levels of campaign participation during these same elections. Findings reveal that political conversation, political messaging, and cognitive reflection mediate the effects of campaign advertising exposure and news consumption on political participation and knowledge, providing considerable support for our theory. This O-S-R-O-R model helps organize a large body of theorizing and research on campaigns and conversation in the communication sciences.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.01333.x

It does so via an exploration of the “memory menu”—the contents and flow of programming—offered by Channel 2, Israel's leading commercial television channel, on the eve of the country's Memorial Day for the Holocaust and the Heroism (MDHH), in which the airing of commercials is banned. In order to do so, the study incorporates a multilevel analysis that probes the structure of entire broadcasting evenings as well as the narrative building blocks that constitute each item. The study investigates the ways in which commercial media outlets operate in the context of “commercial vacuums” as they substitute material capital with symbolic capital. This process is illuminated through Channel 2's inability to work MDHH into its extremely successful routine broadcasting formulas. The channel's MDHH broadcasts construct a commemorative narrative that is insulated from day-to-day Israeli public Holocaust memory discourse; hence they operate as a significant site of Israeli postmemory work. Furthermore, such a narrative not only commemorates the memory of the Holocaust itself but also the ways in which Israeli culture used to narrate the memory of the Holocaust in the past.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01424.x

People from six countries self-reported their assessments of equity and recent relational maintenance strategy use. To assess cultural values, we used Inglehart and Welzel's (2005) cultural map based on the World Values Survey (WVS) results and assigned participants' codes that reflect their country's cultural values: Survival/Self-Expression and Traditional/Secular values. Findings for the entire sample reveal that self-reported relational maintenance strategies vary as equity theory predicts, which probably was due primarily to United States and Spanish responses and slightly to Japanese self-reports of one maintenance strategy. The predicted equity-maintenance links did not emerge for China, South Korea, and the Czech Republic. Secular values decreased the overall self-reports of relational maintenance use. Finally, Self-Expression values altered the influence of overbenefitedness (but not underbenefitedness) on self-reported maintenance behaviors.

Rather, our illustration shows a rough correspondence between major campaign events and a significant negative interaction between political talk and news media use on knowledge of candidate issue stances. We theorize that major campaign media events influence the sheer amount of discussion citizens engage in, and we show that an increase in discussion coincides with an amplification of inaccuracies concerning knowledge of candidate issue stances. This may be due to the increase in the number of individuals talking about politics after these major campaign events, which in turn produces an overall increase in political discussion across the electorate.

I show how the interpretations developed from people's material interactions moderate the effects of the interpretations developed through social interactions on willingness to use the technology in the future. I then demonstrate that, in this particular setting, engineers inadvertently stymied an organizational change of which they were very much in favor by reducing their use of the new technology.

We apply this notion to communication via Lemke's (2000) application of heterochronic interactions to the social realm, and utilize Jordan and Ghin's (2006) conceptualization of the “body” as a self-sustaining embodiment of contexts playing themselves out at different, nested time-scales.

Observers saw a complete videotaped interview (full access to visual, vocal, and verbal cues), heard the complete interview (vocal and verbal access), or read a transcript (verbal access) of a truthful or deceptive suspect being questioned about a mock theft and then rated the interviewee on information, behavior, and image management and truthfulness. Results supported the presence of all four biases, which were most evident when interviewees were deceptive and observers had access to all visual, vocal, and verbal modalities. Deceivers’ messages were judged as increasingly complete, honest, clear, and relevant; their behavior as more involved and dominant; and their overall demeanor as more credible, with the addition of nonverbal cues.

It draws from the theory of communicative action of Jürgen Habermas to discuss strategy as the “other” of communication and explores the paradox of Habermas’s idea of communicative rationality in terms of the prisoner’s dilemma of game theory. The essay considers the extent to which the strategic and the dialogic are woven together in communication and argues that the communicative orientations of interlocutors at any given instance are rightfully regarded as the product of situational logics conditioned by social and cultural commitments extant in that instance.

As cultural mixture is a central feature commodified in these programs, the postcolonial concept hybridity is a particularly useful analytic tool. The notion of “hybrid encounter” is proposed to more accurately describe the contact represented in the texts.

Theories on the narrative structure of fictional narratives and disposition-based theories of media enjoyment suggest that televised fictional narratives tend to portray the world as a just place. We propose that the amount of fiction watched on television predicts the belief in a just world (BJW). Further, we assume this effect to be compatible with the television use/mean-world relationship expressed by cultivation theory. Two cross-sectional studies with N = 128 participants (German sample) and N = 387 (Austrian sample) corroborate our assumptions. The self-reported frequency of watching fiction on television was positively related to the BJW, whereas the general amount of television viewing was positively related to mean- and scary-world beliefs.

The LCT begins by discussing how certain perpetrators gain access to particular types of children. Once in contact with a child, the perpetrator sets in motion the cycle of entrapment, which allows him to communicatively groom and entrap the child into accepting sexual advances. The theory then explores how certain communication responses by the perpetrator and the victim characterize the sustenance or disruption of an ongoing sexually abusive relationship.

Contrary to the proposals of secularization theory, these findings suggest that various religious communities have adopted and in some cases embrace the Internet as part of their contemporary religious mission and strategy for growth. The findings further contribute to historical research on the social construction of technology and lend support to emergent research on the spiritual shaping of Internet technology by religious communities seeking to integrate the Internet into their everyday social and religious practices in wired contexts such as Singapore.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00366.x

This limitation is apparent in the relative neglect of subaltern groups that remain walled off from effective participation in the public sphere.

THCs have been studied as a means to facilitate behavior change by influencing some key intermediate steps that precede the behavioral outcome. These include the extent to which people attend to communications, think about them, find them relevant and salient, and intend to take action. Evidence shows that THCs have achieved modest success in changing a number of cancer-related behaviors, including smoking, diet, exercise, and cancer screening. However, it is likely that THCs could be more effective if they were developed with a greater understanding of message effects and what we refer to as the behavioral pathway. Instead of using unidimensional approaches to influence behavior change, a message effects approach would help researchers identify key leverage points for impact on such intermediate outcomes as persuasion and yielding. Such a strategy also might be used to determine when THCs are the preferred approach and when generic, targeted, or combinations of THCs and targeted communications might be appropriate. Viewing THCs from the perspective of the behavioral pathway might indicate use of different messages, sources, and formats to influence different people at different points on the pathway.

Both arise from Martin’s claims about the phenomena of organizational culture and the various perspectives through which they might be known. The first problem involves Martin’s decoupling of ontology and epistemology, as well as her subsequent oscillation between 2 conflicting clusters of “onto-epistemological” claims. Partly as a result, Martin also overemphasizes the ideational dimensions of organizational culture, thereby inhibiting analysis of its production in and through communication. These problems may negatively affect how communication scholars conceptualize organizational cultural phenomena and analyze data. To mitigate these problems, we offer 2 readings derived from social constructionism, poststructuralism, and critical realism.

The groups are specified as simple cultivation (when estimation of the real world is biased but does match a correct estimation of the television world), over cultivation (when the real world is seen as a replica of the TV world but estimation of television reality is exaggerated), double distortion (when TV reality and the real world are both exaggeratedly estimated), simple no cultivation (when both the real world and the TV world are correctly estimated), and distorted no cultivation (when estimation of the real world is correct but TV reality is incorrectly estimated). The groups are differentiated by the amount of television viewing as the heaviest viewers are in the overcultivation group, and the lightest viewers are in the distorted no cultivation group.

The author concludes that looking at social norms transmission through the lens of ritual performance brings to light three theoretical approaches that might be usefully applied to future social norms research. First, the transmission of social norms may be perpetuated and contested through the conventions associated with ritualized communication performances, rather than through the simple communication of information from one person to another. Second, since ritual performance allows or requires a degree of distancing from the ideal, individuals may resist or play with notions of injunctive norms, perhaps embracing opposing descriptive norms. Finally, since ritual communication is performative, evidence of compliance with social norms may occur symbolically rather than literally.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00004.x

Specifically, this study hypothesized that messages which induce substantial perceptions of (a) threat, (b) response-efficacy, and (c) self-efficacy would result in feelings of anticipated guilt that subsequently motivate behavioral intent and, ultimately, behaviors to avert the threat to unknown others and avoid the future guilt that they might feel personally.

Over time, a positive shift was shown in women's affect toward the breast cancer and online community, and a positive correlation was found between amount of participation and psychosocial well-being.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2005.tb00268.x

Specifically, the authors describe how reciprocal altruism and preference for similarity, coupled with sensitivity toward prestige hierarchies, underscore the exchange and coordination activities of employees' relationships at work. The proposed model of relationship development is discussed in terms of employee adjustment and integration processes. In conclusion, the authors highlight the potential of EP as both (a) a metatheoretic framework through which seemingly disparate areas of scholarship can be unified, and (b) a vehicle for theoretical development, a catalyst of novel predictions about communication in organizations, grounded in ultimate, rather than proximate, causation.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2005.tb00341.x

An experiment (N= 391) was conducted that manipulated type of hierarchy (explicit versus implicit), whether the hierarchy was primed or not, and the location in the hierarchy to which a message was directed. Whereas the hierarchical model predicts only top–down influence of attitudes on each other, a spatial–linkage model predicts that linked attitudes may influence each other regardless of hierarchical position. The results support the spatial–linkage model in that interattitudinal change is constrained less by a concept's relative position in a hierarchical structure than by the concept's association with other concepts in that structure. Furthermore, within these interattitudinal structures, concepts directly targeted by a persuasive message often exhibit less attitude change than related concepts to which the focal concept appears to be linked. Finally, an explicit hierarchy of concepts appears to facilitate interattitudinal influence much more than an implicit hierarchy of concepts does; the key to this facilitation seems to be the mental accessibility of the organizational structure.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2005.tb00863.x

By documenting changes in discourse occurring between 1998 and 2004 over the labeling of music file-sharing as deviant, it seeks to unveil how power machinates in establishing the parameters between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors In doing so, Foucault's work on power is used as a starting point for investigating strategies employed by corporate elites and file-sharers in order to shift the balance of power. The contest between discourses seeking to restrict or enhance the capacities of free agents in online environments is evidenced in the mutability of a legal discourse seeking to normalize online life. Until now, how the online “music pirates” should be disciplined is in a state of flux where certain developments appear to be favoring corporate interests and others, the interests of music file-sharers. In this struggle, online discourses seeking to curtail freedoms and opportunities advanced by corporate elites and online discourses of freedom purported by music file-sharers, are reversible. This reversibility suggests that online, some offline discourses would be a hindrance and as such, their agents could resist the dominant online discourse by engaging in creative behaviors. Likewise, traversing offline producer-led discourses with innovative and creative actions online could lead to consumers' autonomy. This paper concludes that the significance of these online struggles is embedded not only in their outcomes but also in the processes leading to them. Thus, while attempts to curb these online practices and freedoms persist, changes to a discourse guiding trading conditions between the Recording Industry and end-users have been noted, constituting a victory for the latter.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00293.x

After a discussion of these key features of online media, the article presents a general profile of online journalists in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) as well as a first understanding of their perceptions of their role. A Web survey was conducted in spring 2001 among 73 Flemish online journalists. The survey results show, among other things, that most respondents believe that the future of online journalism lies in interactivity, hypertext and multimedia. Building on this suggestion, a second study explores the ways in which 20 Flemish news Websites actively use the added values of the Internet. A checklist was developed to analyse the use of the aforementioned Internet-specific facilities by Flemish online media professionals. The main conclusion is that there is a gap between the (perceived) potential and actual use of the Internet's added values in online news production.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00300.x

The responses to the open-ended question “Why did you join?” were categorized based upon the reasons suggested in the literature. Across 27 communities in 5 different broad types, 569 different reasons from 399 people indicated that most sought either friendship or exchange of information, and a markedly lower percent sought social support or recreation. The reasons were significantly dependent on the grouping of the communities into types. In all the community types information exchange was the most popular reason for joining.

Social support was the second most popular reason for members in communities with health/wellness and professional/occupational topics, but friendship was the second most popular reason among members in communities dealing with personal interests/hobbies, pets, or recreation.

It shows how Internet research perspectives draw upon various established media and technology research traditions. These can be grouped according to their emphasis upon three different aspects of determination influencing media technology outcomes: uses, where the instrumental use of the artifact is brought to the fore; technological, where the form of media technology is focused upon; and social, where the structuring of outcomes by social determinants is central. Consideration of the research traditions emphasizing each of these aspects gives access to previously recognized strengths and weaknesses associated with each. In particular, my critical examination highlights how each perspective can fall into overly deterministic arguments: instrumentalist, technological determinist, and social determinist. As such, I argue that to gain non-reductionist understandings of the Internet, research ideally needs to take into account the complex interplay between multiple constituting elements. I point to a number of existing media technology approaches that can help with this task. However, I also acknowledge the limitations placed on research by resource constraints and recognize that researchers may wish to follow a particular tradition and focus on a single determination.

The article describes the theories, shows how they can be applied to the selection of target beliefs, and, for each theory, defines the criteria for belief selection. The two theories as well as their appropriate analytic strategies are complementary rather than conflicting.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2003.tb00287.x

However, past research shows that the effectiveness of social support from family members and friends varies over the life span. Both the stage model of life satisfaction and compensatory processes associated with aging provide accounts for why this may be the case. Accordingly, age was predicted to moderate the association between perceived functional and structural social support and the experience of depressive symptoms and loneliness. Age was also predicted to be associated with lower relationship standards that allow people to remain content regardless of whether available social support decreases. This moderational model was tested in a community-based sample of 325 adults ranging in age from 19 to 85 years. Results indicated that social support from family members and sheer contact with them, as well as social support from a spouse or partner, was most strongly and negatively related to the psychosocial problems in the younger participants. Age also moderated the association between relationship standards and loneliness. Consistent with the assumptions of the stage model of life satisfaction and previous research on compensatory processes associated with aging, older people do not appear to be as dependent as younger people on receiving social support from diverse sources in order to maintain a sense of well-being.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2003.tb00842.x

To study this phenomenon, a survey administered immediately after her fatal car accident compared people's level of involvement with Princess Diana to their viewing of stories about her funeral and their attitudes toward the press. Results showed that gender and age similarities predicted involvement with Princess Diana. This involvement, in turn, predicted people's media use in response to her death and their attitudes toward the press.

The findings indicate that (a) citizens increased markedly as sources in news coverage after September 11; (b) Arab Americans spoke from more favorable positions of status than African Americans; and (c) racial minorities may face a situation in which they de facto “compete” with other minorities for space in news coverage.

The concept of relationship awareness began to form during the process of fulfilling an assignment in graduate school. The concept was later expanded to include the situational contexts and the individual factors that modify the association between relationship awareness and relationship satisfaction. The next phase of the theory broadened the contexts in which relationship awareness is examined. Theorizing on relationship awareness has begun to incorporate sociocultural contexts. By examining the role of cultural beliefs on thinking and talking about relationships, this new development also has the potential to extend our understanding of the underlying factors that determine whether the effects of relationship awareness are positive or negative.

This paper combines linguistic analysis, a survey, and interviews to examine English and Arabic language use in online communications by a group of young professionals in Egypt. The study indicates that, among this group, English is used overwhelmingly in Web use and in formal e-mail communication, but that a Romanized version of Egyptian Arabic is used extensively in informal e-mail messages and online chats. This online use of English and Arabic is analyzed in relation to broader social trends of language, technology, globalization, and identity.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2002.tb00157.x

Also, persuasion mediators and moderators such as topic involvement should be reduced in importance. Evidence in support of these propositions are reviewed in this article.

In the metatheory developed here, the research program is inclusive of 3 paradigmatic outlooks, called cognitive, constructionist, and critical, that provide researchers with specific images with which to examine the interaction of media frames and individual- or social-level reality. Thus, contra Entman (1993), I argue that there is not, nor should there be, a single “mended” paradigm of framing research.

In order to test this assumption and to identify potential moderator variables influencing the strength of the predicted association, a meta-analysis was conducted. Whether speaking time is used to convey dominance to the same extent that it is used in inferring dominance was tested by contrasting studies concerned with dominance expressed in speaking time with studies of inferred dominance based on speaking time. Overall, and for the investigated subcategories of studies, the relationship between dominance and speaking time was significant. The strength of the associations, however, differed considerably due to the influence of moderator variables. The results showed that inferred dominance studies showed stronger associations between speaking time and dominance as opposed to the expressed dominance studies. Additionally, if dominance was expressed due to dominance-role assignments, the association between speaking time and dominance was stronger than if individuals with different levels of trait dominance interacted. For men, the association between speaking time and dominance was stronger than for women, and same-gender groups showed stronger associations than opposite-gender groups.

As development projects are designed and implemented by Third World men and women, local symbolic constructions of gender, class, and race permeate development discourse. The result is a multilayered discourse of development that negotiates Western discourse of modernity with local discourses of race, class, and gender. This analysis examines the intersection of development discourse and local patriarchal discourse in a World Bank project implemented in the agricultural frontier in Colombia. Through textual analysis of project documents and a consultant's field diary, the analysis sheds light on the rhetorical formulas, metaphors, and iconic signifiers that articulate women as ahistorical, static, and passive subjects. Despite its bottom—up, participatory approach to development, this World Bank project keeps marginalizing women, assuming that only men play crucial roles in processes of community and nation building and considering only male community members in processes of empowerment. In conclusion, the article explains how this type of development discourse maintains and reinforces patriarchal cultural codes that exclude women from active participation in development projects.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2001.tb00254.x

The crucial question is how heavily are international negotiators influenced by their own cultural values? When negotiating with a culturally disparate partner, what are the separate and cumulative effects of culture and contextual variables on negotiator communication? To answer these questions, the effect of culture (here, individualism-collectivism) on integrative (information exchange) and distributive (fixed-sum errors) negotiating is assessed in 32 intercultural dyads. In addition, the contextual effects of role (buyer vs. seller), preconceptions about negotiating (anticipated competition), and mutual adaptation (interdependence in information exchange) are examined. Preliminary results suggest that role requirements influence negotiators more heavily than culture.

Participants were recently married men and women (100 Americans and 102 Chinese) who completed questionnaires providing assessments of desired and experienced levels of spousal support for each of 5 support types. Men and women did not differ systematically with respect to the levels of support they experienced from their spouses; however, women reported desiring significantly higher levels of support from their spouses than did men for all 5 types of support.

The evaluation proceeds at a general level, drawing upon more specific Internet research to provide a broad understanding of the democratic possibilities and limitations of the present Internet. The analysis shows that vibrant exchange of positions and rational critique does take place within many online fora. However, there are a number of factors limiting the expansion of the public sphere online. These factors include the increasing colonization of cyberspace by state and corporate interests, a deficit of reflexivity, a lack of respectful listening to others, the difficulty of verifying identity claims and information put forward, the exclusion of many from online political fora, and the domination of discourse by certain individuals and groups.

Problematic integration and uncertainty management theories are comparatively broad, and they exhibit an open, web-like structure. The former theory scrutinizes the complex intersection of probability assessments and evaluations of the objects of these assessments, whereas the latter examines the various ways in which people cope with uncertainty, including sometimes attempting to increase it. The paper also compares meanings of “uncertainty” in the 3 theories as well as the roles played by natural language in the communication-uncertainty interface.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2001.tb02891.x

While research has consistently demonstrated the interpersonal nature of IRC, and is now turning to more structurally-oriented topics, it is argued that IRC research now needs to systematically address links between interaction structures, technological mediation and the instantiation and development of interpersonal relationships within a framework that privileges IRC interaction and social explanations. This exploration of the openings of IRC interactions is positioned as a step in that direction. The openings investigated in the study are those that occur directly following user's entries into public IRC channels, termed the newly-joined users' Channel Entry Phase (CEP). It is found that turn coordination in the CEP is often ambiguous, has the potential to disrupt relationship development, and leads to considerable emphasis on interactive strategies for the clear ordering of opening phases.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2001.tb00125.x

However, when predicting perceived message effectiveness, the positive affects showed variation in the sign and magnitude of the coefficients, as did the negative affects.

The principle of interactivity refers to the constellation of structural and experiential features associated with interactivity that systematically affect communication processes and outcomes. One such feature is degree of participation. In deceptive interchanges, senders may engage in dialogic (high participation, two-way) or monologic (low participation, one-way) communication. According to the principle of interactivity, dialogue should advantage deceivers relative to monologue due to increased mutuality between sender and receiver and greater opportunities for deceivers to improve their performance over time. An experiment in which friends or strangers alternated between deceiving and telling the truth to a partner under dialogue or monologue conditions tested this principle. All hypotheses received some support. Relative to monologue, dialogue created more mutuality among strangers. Dialogue also enabled deceivers to better manage their informational content, speech fluency, nonverbal demeanor, and image, resulting in less accurate deception detection by partners. These results support the interactivity principle and interpersonal deception theory, from which the principle emanated.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00791.x

This approach involves developing a caring relationship with students, searching for means and moments of speaking as equals, and encouraging shared responsibility for learning together. Educational friendship emphasizes positive and edifying communicative stances and relationships of teachers with individual students and toward classes as collectives. Even given this relationship, teachers and students face ongoing challenges in managing dialectical tensions, which make the sustained achievement of educational friendships a risky and fragile endeavor. These friendships are further limited by teachers' and students' subject positions, the structural inequality that historically and institutionally pervades educational contexts, and the risk of mystification that haunts offers of affection from persons in power positions to subordinates. Emphasizing good will, dialogue, respect for distance and differences among persons, and the equal validity of each student's life and learning experiences, teaching as friendship seeks to establish classes as judicious and caring political communities.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2000.tb00176.x

The rules of interaction of this nontraditional means of political communication are identified and the complex relationships between the messages within their social situation are investigated using an ethnographic model. This analysis reveals that the medium does indeed constitute a structured means of expression with identifiable forms, rules, and usages, affording the person in the street a way of participating in the national discourse, bypassing traditional avenues of influence. The detailed examination of a single political bumper sticker reveals a structure parallel to the overall code, further demonstrating the intricacy of the messages. The analysis shows how this political discourse reflects social norms peculiar to Israel and how its use has become an affirmation of cultural identity. Because the fundamental properties of political bumper stickers have now been exposed, it is possible to examine how the actual use of this medium changes the structure of political agency in society through the presumption that ordinary individuals have the right of access to the public debate of national political issues, a right heretofore exclusively the prerogative of institutional power holders.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2000.tb02841.x

The findings of this first test (N=52 couples) indicate that partners of alcoholics or otherwise drug-dependent individuals reinforce the substance-abusive behavior more before, and punish the substance-abusive behavior more after, they label the behavior problematic.

The dilemmas of characterizing the target group and the holidays in these texts are examined and linked with the notions of ageism, anti-ageism, and the denial of aging. Second, through the analysis of 2 extracts of spoken discourse between travel agency staff and older clients, I show how the selling and buying of these holidays involves potentially problematic age-salient positioning of the client.

The essay seeks to come to some insight about the human experience of this dual existence. The essay develops arguments for further exploration of the academic life in the social disciplines as a way of coming to a better understanding of the subject-object dilemma by reconceptualizing “dilemma ” as “human data-source”; reconceptualizing dualism as wholism; and simultaneously conceptualizing the academy as a situated organizational context that functions as a site for micropractices of power, domination, and human oppression.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1999.tb00207.x

First, I review the logic of representation within the terms encoding and decoding, and, relying on the ideas of John Dewey, I explicate its various theoretical inadequacies. Hence, I add Dewey's support to Stewart's claim that speech is not a tool-like system of representations, but rather, is primarily constitutive. Second, and more critically, I appeal to several interrelated concepts in Dewey's writings to show that the representational view is valid and legitimate if it is taken as a derivative possibility given to speech's constitutive nature. Third, I unpack developments in the phenomenological notion of intentionality to argue that humans are fundamentally suspended in a network of intentional relations. Thus, with the notion of “intentionality” developed mainly by Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, I argue that we can accommodate for representational accounts while holding fast to speech's primary constitutive character. I conclude by suggesting that the different intentional relations (e.g., constitutive and representational) are nothing less than different modes by which we temporalize the temporality we are.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1999.tb00161.x

To investigate this idea, the author further cuts against the grain by returning critical theory to its “mere” philosophical roots in wonder, and in doing so keeps an eye on the tension between philosophy and change. The author engages a version of the private-public distinction and against the backdrop of the reading of the Eleventh Thesis links his reading with the work of Nancy Fraser and her take on the public sphere and her Habermasian concern for discourse ethics. To assist in the author's utilization of Fraser's work, he weaves aspects of the thought of Arendt—namely her Kantian-inspired discussions of impartiality and radical plurality, as well as taste and judgment—into the discussion. In addition to this, the author's recent work is combined with Fraser and Arendt—particularly the concepts of the ethics of relief and the work of waiting from his Long Path to Nearness. The work begins and ends with the understanding that, as Fraser puts it: “something like Habermas's idea of the public sphere is indispensable to critical social theory and to democratic political practice.” If only the simple wearing were so simple. —Heidegger, “The Origin of the Work of Art”(1977b)",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00229.x

This paper examines the behavior of one such organization. The analysis is based on a case study of the communication structure and content of communications among members of a virtual organization during a four-month period. We empirically measure the structure of a virtual organization and find evidence of hierarchy. The findings imply that the communication structure of a virtual organization may exhibit different properties on different dimensions of structure. We also examine the relationship among task routineness, organizational structure, and performance. Results indicate that the fit between structure and task routineness affects the perception of performance, but may not affect the actual performance of the organization. Thus, this virtual organization is similar to traditional organizations in some ways and dissimilar in other ways. It was similar to traditional organizations in so far as task-structure fit predicted perceived performance. However, it was dissimilar to traditional organizations in so far as fit did not predict objective performance. To the extent that the virtual organizations may be similar to traditional organizations, existing theories can be expanded to study the structure and perceived performance of virtual organizations. New theories may need to be developed to explain objective performance in virtual organizations.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1998.tb00079.x

In this model, the identification process is treated as a duality involving identities that create and are created by identifications, which are themselves observed in social interactions with others. The structural component of this model is composed of several possible identities conceptualized primarily in terms of regions varying in size or position and tenure, possessing front and back regions, and displaying both unique and overlapping regions with one another. The existence of multiple identities implicates multiple corresponding “targets” of attachment and expressions of connection. Activity and activity foci are included in the model to help define the situation and thus account for identification with one target as opposed to or along with others at various times. In this situation-sensitive view, activity is presumed to “link” to a certain identity region (or set of overlapping regions) more so than to others.

Overall, the results indicated that remote employees' self-efficacy assessments play a critical role in influencing their remote work effectiveness, perceived productivity, job satisfaction and ability to cope. Furthermore, strong relationships were observed between employees' remote work self-efficacy judgments and several antecedents, including remote work experience and training, best practices modeling by management, computer anxiety, and IT capabilities.

Social issues became the embodiment of Benetton's product and, through the transformation into commodities, lost their significance as problematic human conditions.

The Bill aims at ensuring that the laws which already apply to obscene, indecent, and harassing use of telephones and mail should also apply to computer communications. On the other hand, in Japan, a similar problem regarding telephone use has been solved effectively by the private sector's voluntary self-control. NTT (a counterpart of ATT before its split) refuses to contract with telephone service providers intending to supply services of what might be considered obscene content. For NTT, which is a common carrier, (enjoying a monopoly in local telephone service) to refuse to contract with such information providers required administrative guidance (so-called gyoseishidoh) from the Ministry of Telecommunication. This typical Japanese approach involving gyoseishidoh is effective.

These results suggest the importance of examining the impact of peer communication for reducing uncertainty for employees involved in job transitions instead of focusing exclusively on superior-subordinate communication.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00387.x

This debate occurs under circumstances of “empirical diversity” that involve researchers who investigate wife abuse with different methods and adduce a range of often seemingly incompatible facts. Consequently, disputants confront a special pluralistic version of the ancient rhetorical problem of invention and judgment: How can one establish common grounds for creation and evaluation of arguments about facts in the presence of empirical diversity? This essay conducts a topical analysis of Straus's arguments, which reveals two distinct approaches to this problem. One approach locates adjudicating standards in values and assumptions rooted deeply within Straus's preferred orientation toward the issues. Arguments premised on that kind of standard polarize rhetorical judgment under empirically diverse circumstances. The other approach locates standards in practical points of interdependence among disputants. Arguments premised on the interdependence topos open possibilities for more constructive deliberation among those who argue for seemingly incompatible facts.

These differences have important implications for costs, benefits, and the realization of a critical mass of users that is necessary for realization of the good. We also explore multifunctional goods that combine various features and hybrid goods that link private goods to public ones. We examine the applicability of two key assumptions of public goods theory to interactive communication systems.

Formulated in reference to systemic Parsonian functionalism, which dominated the broader social sciences, these criticisms are relatively easy to reconcile within the contextual, actionist Mertonian tradition, which took root in the communications context, but only through a constructive dialogue with the cultural studies and cultural indicators approaches, both of which have spent the last decade investigating a traditionally functionalist concern – the hypothesis of cultural systems integration.

By this thought experiment, however, we can illuminate many peculiarities of the conduct of communication by commercial radio, learn more about the application of theoretical models to the evaluation of practicing institutions, and offer assessments of commercial radio that derive from communication theory, rather than from economics, law, politics, or business concerns.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1996.tb01464.x

Statements from both perspectives about four German Nazi generals were coded at the sentence level with regard to three aspects: the reference of the sentence subject to the defendant (specific vs. diffuse), the linguistic category of the sentence predicate (action verbs, state verbs, adjectives), and the evaluative tone of the utterance (negative, neutral, positive). Distinct language patterns were demonstrated for the opposing parties, reflecting theoretical predictions about the attributional implications of specific linguistic tools. Apart from the fact that the same defendant's behavior was described in more positive terms by defense attorneys than prosecutors, the two sides used a number of less obtrusive, more subtle strategies. In particular, defense attorneys tended to raise positive defendant attributes to a higher level of linguistic abstractness, avoided direct person references for negative statements, and projected unavoidable negative statements onto the prosecution. In contrast, prosecutors produced the highest rate of action verbs, which implicitly suggest internal attributions of responsibility. In addition to direct negative references to the individual defendant, they also used global references to the defendant's Nazi in-group to convey the inherently negative meaning of the defendant's behavior. In general, these findings mirror previous results on the role of language in interpersonal and intergroup settings.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00372.x

The BAE posits that probing causes message sources to strategically adapt behavioral cues so as to appear “honest.” This behavioral adaptation subsequently causes message recipients to perceive probed sources as truthful. Across several published studies and convention papers, researchers have claimed empirical support for the BAE.

Many are the conditions which must be fulfilled if the Great Society is to become a Great Community …. The highest and most difficult kind of inquiry and a subtle, delicate, vivid and responsive art of communication must take possession of the physical machinery of transmission and circulation and breath life into it. When the machine age has thus perfected its machinery, it will be a means of life and not its despotic master. – John Dewey (1938)

Social accounts of learning and human knowledge have led to attempts to reorganize schools as learning communities. This paper examines the utility of the World Wide Web for aiding in the construction of school-based and work-based learning communities. An ordered list of interactions is provided to characterize the depth of students' entry into new learning communities. Current offerings on the World Wide Web are then surveyed in terms of these categories. Finally, proposals are advanced for enhancing the architecture of the WWW to facilitate its use for the creation and operation of learning communities.",3,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1996.tb00188.x

Results indicate that interpersonal communication dominates all other communication modalities in influencing voters' perceptions of candidates during the distant phase of primaries, and its effect persists into the localized phase.

Within a practical discipline perspective, theory is conceived as a rational reconstruction of practices for the purpose of informing further practice and reflection. The theoretical reconstruction of communication practices can be undertaken at three interrelated levels of analysis, here called the technical, problem, and philosophical levels. Based on interpretive discourse analysis of recorded departmental colloquia and interviews with participants, we identify a complex interactional dilemma that arises within this type of communicative situation (problem level), specific techniques by which participants attempt to cope with that dilemma (technical level), and two situated ideals to which they have recourse for reflecting on the normative basis of their own and others' actions (philosophical level).

We argue that in order to advance theory about culture's influence on communication, researchers must begin to examine how culture affects individual level (psychological) processes and, subsequently, how these processes affect communication. The image of self, referred to as self-construal, is an ideal candidate to perform the role of linking culture to behavior. The self is shaped by cultural forces and affects many, if not all, communication behaviors. The proposed strategy is applied in the test of a path-analytic model linking cultural collectivism with interdependent self-construals and, ultimately, high-context communication.

Rather, these authors suggest that the slower speech production characteristic of such messages is the result of difficulties in assembling, or integrating, incompatible message features. Recent evidence, however, indicates that this account is incomplete and in need of revision. Toward this end, we advance a complexity account that suggests that there are increased processing-capacity and temporal demands associated with formulating and maintaining more complex message representations. The article then reports four experimental studies of this complexity account. Experiments 1 and 2 operationalize complexity as the amount of information to be communicated in a message. These studies indicate that complexity does affect pause-phonation ratio and average pause duration. Experiments 3 and 4 operationalize complexity as the coherence of the information to be conveyed in a message.

First, we explore the role of the Web as a distribution channel and a medium for marketing communications. Second, we examine the factors that have led to the development of the Web as a commercial medium, evaluating the benefits it provides to both consumers and firms and its attractive size and demographic characteristics. Third, we discuss the barriers to commercial growth of the Web from both the supply and demand side perspectives. This analysis leads to a new classification of commercialization efforts that categorizes commercial Web sites into six distinct types including 1) Online Storefront, 2) Internet Presence, 3) Content, 4) Mall, 5) Incentive Site, and, 6) Search Agent. The first three comprise the “Integrated Destination Site,” and the latter three represent forms of “Web Traffic Control.” Our framework, argued in the context of integrated marketing, facilitates greater understanding of the Web as a commercial medium, and allows examination of commercial Web sites in terms of the opportunities and challenges firms face in the rush towards commercialization.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1995.tb00165.x

To account for these anomalies, a conceptual model of the process of world-view construction from long-term television exposure is presented. The motivation behind the model stems from the realization that cultivation takes place in a distinct temporal sequence. To accurately capture the implications of this sequence an ecologically valid view of the cultivation process must be developed. The model includes several classes of variables that encompass the entire temporal sequence involved in constructing world-view from television exposure. These variables are theorized to interact with each other, and with television viewing, to differentially affect world view. Examples are provided to suggest ways in which the model cun be used to explain each of the anomalies.

This study is concerned with analyzing a range of factors that might have contributed to this hyper coverage. Employing a time-series model, and examining monthly coverage of suicide stories between 1910 and 1920, the authors found that hyper coverage was not caused by increased suicide in the city or nation but was generated by a dynamic combination of institutional and human factors. Further analysis of New York Times editorials suggests support for the thesis that the editor acted as a moral entrepreneur. The paper's editorials were concerned with suicide as a threat to urban civilization, a common moral theme during the “progressive era.” A similar analysis for the depression era, 1929–1939, showed no hyper coverage, and again found that the level of coverage was unrelated to actual suicide figures in the city and nation. The study concludes that suicide is a private event that is usually not examined by The New York Times on the front page and that media coverage of suicide is unrelated to the incidence of suicide in the real world.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1994.tb00677.x

Five hypotheses are formulated regarding the relationships between individualistic-collectivistic orientation (an important dimension of“culture”) and these five conversational constraints. Data were collected from 892 participants (undergraduates studying in Korea, Hawaii, and the mainland United States). After being presented at random with one of the six request situations, participants rated the perceived importance of each conversational constraint in that situation. The results indicate that the perceived importance of clarity was higher in the more individualistic cultures. On the other hand, the perceived importance of avoiding hurting the hearer's feelings and of minimizing imposition were higher in the more collectivistic cultures. The perceived importance of effectiveness and of avoiding negative evaluation by the hearer, on the other hand, did not significantly differ across the three cultural groups.

At the same time, violence on our side (i.e., Israeli soldiers) is explained in situational terms. Analysis of the families' discourse reveals that Jewish and Arab nationalists accept the text at face value: Jewish extremists read it hegemonically while their Arab counterparts decode it oppositionally.

Speakers can opt to express directives, as well as other speech acts, in either a direct or indirect way. A preference for indirect directives has often been assumed in cross-cultural theorizing.

Verbalizations elicited by 10 topic cues (e.g., sexuality, education of children, and housework) were coded by valence (positive vs. negative), group reference (ingroup vs. outgroup), and the abstractness of the predicate (descriptive action verb, interpretive action verb, state verb, and adjective). Outgroup discrimination was confined to female respondents, as manifested in their tendency to describe men in more negative terms than women. Outgroup-related statements in general, and outgroup-derogative statements in particular, were more abstract than statements about the ingroup. However, outgroup discrimination was due more to repetition of biased statements than to differential abstraction. The distribution of discrimination across topics is neither related to conflict proneness nor to the empathic experience associated with intimate (e.g., sexuality) as opposed to other topics (e.g., driving). Outgroup homogeneity is apparent in the consistency of language profiles characterizing outgroup descriptions for different topics but not in generalization over outgroup members. Discrimination and homogeneity are systematically related across topics, and this relation is not due to evaluative constraints. Rather, discrimination is strongest for topics for which the most distinctive and reliable language profiles are available.

Experiment 2 supports the notion of facial expression as interjection by demonstrating that most any conversational facial expression, regardless of Us true source emotion or of the affect it signals in isolation, tends to be interpreted according to the affect associated with the verbal context in which it occurs. In addition to the identification of context-dependent interjection as yet another function of facial expression, the study suggests a pressing need for further investigation of nonverbal behavior in natural-conversation settings.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1993.tb00314.x

A sample of 82 couples representing violent, nonviolent distressed, and nondistressed relationships completed self-report instruments on verbal aggression and argumentativeness for themselves and their spouses and marital satisfactionfor themselves. Results show that abusive couples experience less marital satisfaction, less accurately recall each other's behavior, and have significant reciprocity in their verbal aggression compared to nonviolent distressed and nondistressed couples.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1993.tb00323.x

The key to defining such a measure is to utilize the feasible outcome sets of Nash (1950) and to represent the bargainer's concessions by a path in the feasible outcome set. By mathematically modeling the speed with which the bargainer concedes, it becomes possible to develop a measure of bargaining toughness that takes into account not only how much the bargainer has conceded, but how fast he or she has done so.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01248.x

How are those who use these different types of disclosures differentially construed? A set of three studies was designed to investigate three general issues. Study 1 asked respondents to rate characters who disclosed in a boastful, positive, or negative fashion. Boasters and positive disclosers were viewed as more competent than negative disclosers, negative and positive disclosers were viewed as more socially sensitive than boasters, and positive disclosers were best liked. In Study 2, the gender of the target disclosing positively or boastfully was manipulated. Compared to the boaster, the positive discloser was rated as more socially involved and feminine (less masculine) but less competent. Polarized judgments were made by both genders. Study 3 had individuals generate “boasts” and “positive statements.” The few gender differences that emerged suggest that although females’ bragging strategies may be less extreme or extensive, it is only when gender information is known that the brags of men and women are differentially construed. The present work suggests that men and women, as perceivers, may differentially activate cognitive structures (involving social involvement and femininity, on one hand, and competence and masculinity, on the other) when evaluating men versus women. The nature of the communication itself (boasts being perceived as more masculine and positive disclosures as more feminine) may exacerbate such differential activation in the construction of “mental models” of another's communication.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1992.tb00557.x

The authors' proposed approach to this is based on: (a) a competitive complementarity with commercial television; (b) a qualitative sense of programming priorities; and (c) the social character of public broadcasting, which entails major cultural, political, and social functions. Asking whether such a recipe is viable, the authors conclude that it depends on how public television fares in its competition with commercial television to shape viewers' expectations of programming. They give reasons why this can be waged successfully, thus serving as a model for other democracies, as they increasingly realize that commercial television alone cannot satisfy a society's communication needs.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00766.x

It is demonstrated that left to itself this market will stratify information provision and fail to provide all citizens with the same quality of information and opinion.

Results indicated that female physicians are expected to use instrumentally unaggressive strategies while male physicians are expected to use strategies that fall in the mid-range of a verbal aggression continuum. There were no differences in expectations based on the gender of patients. The second study manipulated physician communication and physician gender to predict an interaction such that when male physicians deviate from moderately aggressive, direction-giving strategies, using either more affiliative tactics or more instrumentally aggressive strategies, compliance increases. It was also predicted that affective satisfaction with male physicians would increase with increased use of affiliative, nonaggressive compliance-gaining messages. Based on expectancy theory, an inverse linear relationship between the use of instrumental verbal aggression and compliance and affective satisfaction was predicted for female physicians.

To the extent that these four ideological orientations define research and scholarship, the interpersonal field is at risk of reifying contemporary values and uncritically reproducing and legitimizing the relations of power that constitute the social order.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1991.tb00014.x

A distinction is advanced between the life history oi a social relationship and the interactional co-presence of the relationship partners. The logics of relationship-based behavior and interaction-based behavior are thus contrasted. Some social relationships are defined by their communities as continuous, that is, as extending beyond the moments when the partners are in face-to-face interaction with each other. Three spatiotemporal frameworks, in which devices for constructing the continuity of social relationships in anticipation of, during, or subsequent to periods of physical and interactional non-co-presence, are discussed. The implications of this perspective for the study of strategic communication and of the continuity of other social forms are noted.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1991.tb00008.x

These two broad approaches are built on very different assumptions and the interpretive approach might be better thought of as a forin of metaphorical analysis. Within the ontological approach, conventional definiticns of genre are unsatisfactory and situational definitions too vague. A revised perspective avoids these difficulties by recognizing that situations are complexes of needs, purposes, and societal limitations that in turn create a set of strategic constraints, which perceptually limits the rhetor. This distinction is illustrated via a case study of a recent controversy concerning a National Academy of Science study of the homeless.

Multiple models were considered, each model defining motivation to reduce uncertainty in a different way. Motivation to reduce uncertainty was defined as a scope condition (Model 2), as tolerance for uncertainty (Model 3), as a weighted function of uncertainty by its importance (Model 4), and as the difference between one's uncertainty level and one's tolerance for uncertainty (Models 5a and 5b). Each of these models was compared to the baseline model (Model 1) derived from the original presentation of the theory where level of uncertainty, by itself, serves as a determinant of various communication behaviors. Tests of these models in terms of their ability to predict information seeking and attraction reveal that none of the models provides a consistent integration of motivation to reduce uncertainty into uncertainty reduction theory. Rather, tolerance for uncertainty (Model 3) is one of three determinants of information seeking, while level of uncertainty (Model 1) is one of three determinants of attraction. This inability to integrate motivation to reduce uncertainty into uncertainty reduction theory can be attributed to the consistent failure to find support for deviance and incentive value as determinants of tolerance for uncertainty, the rejection of Axiom 3 in uncertainty reduction theory (which specifies a positive relationship between uncertainty and information seeking), and the rejection of Theorem 17 (which specifies a negative relationship between information seeking and liking).",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1990.tb00226.x

On the basis of previous communication research, involvement is viewed as audience activity with both cognitive and affective dimensions. Cognitive involvement reflects attention to, recognition of, and elaboration on media content. Emotional involvement reflects internal feelings. The purpose of this study was to check the validity of this view of involvement in the context of local television news by (a) testing the relationship between the strength of news viewing motivation and involvement intensity, (b) testing the relationship between the type of news viewing motivation and involvement orientation, and (c) testing the relationship between cognitive and emotional involvement. Adult local news viewers (N = 305) completed pertinent questionnaires. Pearson and canonical correlation partly supported the proposed view of media involvement. Utilitarian viewing motivation was associated with higher cognitive involvement and feelings of anger while watching local news. Diversionary motivation was associated with feeling happy while watching news. There were links between cognitive and emotional involvement with news. The discussion focuses on the importance of involvement and motivation in media effects research.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1990.tb00222.x

This approach locates the origin of behavioral traits in the activation and arousal systems and, consequently, it offers a more fundamental explanation of personality traits than is typically seen in the mass communication literature. In the interest of applying this view, we propose the Miller Behavioral Style Scale (MBSS) as a measure of an individual's tendency toward activation or arousal. Study I was conducted to test the prediction that scores on the MBSS would be related to the intensity of negative affect during a film segment from Nightmare on Elm Street. The results were encouraging in that the predicted relationship emerged between the MBSS and skin conductance responses. Study U was conducted to test the prediction that scores on the MBSS would be related to information-seeking of highly negative emotional information transmitted by the media when the space shuttle, Challenger, exploded. The results indicated support for this prediction. Implications for future research in mass communication are discussed.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1988.tb00181.x

Speech behaviors examined included conversants’ speech rates, turn durations, interruptive speakovers, and vocal back-channels and the degree to which they performed these speech behaviors similar to those of their partners. Social evaluative dimensions examined included communication satisfaction, communicative competence, sociointellectual status, aesthetic quality, and dynamism. Several findings were noteworthy. First, participants viewed their conversational partners most favorably and transcript readers viewed them least favorably. Second, there were few significant correlations between social evaluative judgments across different perceivers’ perspectives. Third, while the perceivers’ social judgments of conversants were often related to the conversants’ speech behaviors, there was little consistency across perceivers’ perspectives regarding which speech behaviors were predictive of these judgments.

Traditional theories of motor mimicry view this behavior as an indicator of a vicarious cognitive or empathic experience, that is, of taking the role of the other or of “feeling oneself into” the other person. However, Bavelas, Black, Lemery, and Mullett (1986) have shown that motor mimicry of pain is affected by communicative variables and acts as a nonverbal message indicating that the observer is aware of and concerned about the other's situation. This raises a more general question: Is communication its primary or secondary function? We propose (i) that motor mimicry functions as a nonverbal, analogic, relationship message about similarity between observer and other and (ii) that this message is encoded according to Gestalt principles of form, in that the observer physically mirrors the other. In other words, the observer maintains a relationship with the other. The special case of left/right leaning when observer and other are facing each other permits a test of our theory against two theories that treat motor mimicry as an indicator of vicarious experience. The results of three experiments showed that when motor mimicry by an observer facing someone who is leaning left or right occurs, it is both displayed and decoded in the form consistent with a communication theory; this form is called reflection symmetry. We conclude that, because of the topography of the response, the primary function of motor mimicry must be communicative and that any relationship to vicarious processes is secondary. A similar analysis of other nonverbal behaviors may well reveal that they are also expressions to another person rather than expressions of infrapsychic states.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1988.tb00158.x

Results for both samples revealed that social identity has a significant positive effect on uncertainty reduction processes. This effect, however, was moderated by prototypicality; that is, it occurred in relationships where the partner was viewed as “typical,” but not in relationships where the partner was viewed as “atypical.” When controlling for the partner's ethnicity in the Caucasian analysis, social identity had a significant effect on communication with black partners, but not with Mexican-American partners. This finding was explained by status characteristic theory (e.g., Berger & Zelditch, 1985). The intimacy of interethnic relationship also accounted for a significant portion of the variance. The effect for intimacy was manifested in relationships where the partner was viewed as typical, as well as when the partner was viewed as atypical.

There is very little evidence about what cognitive processes allow viewers to construct television-biased beliefs. The present study tests two possible processes: First, that perceptions of the television world serve as an intermediate step between fragmented incidental learning from television and beliefs about the real world and second, that beliefs closely linked to television content are an intermediate step in implying more general values and beliefs. These two hypotheses were tested in one adult and three adolescent samples, two in the United States and two in Australia. Across a range of cultivation questions, the basic cultivation result generally replicated that heavy viewers had beliefs about the world that appeared influenced by television. However, neither process hypothesis was supported. Although the null findings on the first hypothesis do not rule out construction from learned fragments, findings on the second hypothesis contradict cultivation's second-order effect. “Close” beliefs and their implied counterparts were unrelated, and cultivation relationships for these implied variables occurred only for those with real-world biased “dose” beliefs. Exploration of this result demonstrated that cultivation of both kinds of beliefs occurred more of ten for adolescents with high academic skills, suggesting that if cultivation occurs, it is a more active and intellectually demanding process than previously proposed.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1987.tb00118.x

Further, different ways of looking at marriage are reflected in the use of particular content themes. A typology of content themes was derived from transcripts of conversations and the typology was used to code the discussions of married couples. The content themes of different marital types (i.e., traditional, separate, and independent) and more and less satisfied spouses were compared. As expected, traditional couples emphasized communal themes, such as togetherness, and separate couples emphasized individualistic themes, such as personality and separateness. Although the effects of marital satisfaction were not consistent, satisfaction tended to be positively associated with communal and impersonal themes and negatively associated with individual themes.

A social meaning model holds that differing levels of gaze have such clear meaning that gaze alone accounts for the reactions to it. A nonverbal expectancy violations model holds that normative behaviors are expected in social interactions with strangers and that violating these expectations produces different results depending on whether the violator is deemed highly “rewarding” or “nonrewarding.” This experiment, the third in a series, proposed to extend the violations model by incorporating the concept of positive and negative types ofviolations. Subjects (N = 145) interviewed one of four confederate interviewees who manipulated one of three levels of eye gaze (nearly constant, normal, andnearly constant aversion) and who were assigned one of two levels of reward (highly qualified for the job or highly unqualified). Differential gaze behavior resulted in varied impressions of attraction, credibility, and relational communication, with gaze aversion producing consistently negative effects. Interpretations and communication consequences were mediated by reward, gender, and confederate differences.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1986.tb00089.x

Questionnaires were completed by 329 persons. Pearson and partial correlations supported hypotheses linking loneliness with less interpersonal communication and both loneliness and parasocial interaction with more television reliance. Loneliness and parasocial interaction were not correlated. Canonical correlation analysis supported expectations that instrumental news viewing for information was related to more parasocial interaction and perceived news realism; viewing news for exciting entertainment, news affinity, and news viewing levels correlated positively with this pattern. Ritualized news viewing for time consumption was related to more television viewing, but to less news viewing, duration, and affinity. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis identified news affinity, perceived news realism, and information news viewing motives as salient predictors of parasocial interaction with a favorite local television news personality.

Specifically, the study attempted to test the general claim that the group's satisfaction of critical task-achievement functions (or requisite conditions) is a better predictor of decision-making performance than the discussion procedures it employs in arriving at a decision. A total of 48 three-member groups were randomly assigned to one of four different discussion formats. The groups were trained to use their assigned format in arriving at a decision regarding a human relations case. Two-way ANOVA revealed no significant main effect for “discussion format,” but a significant main effect for “satisfaction of requisite conditions.” No interaction effect was discovered. The findings thus offer strong support for the “functional” perspective. Other analyses indicated that the satisfaction of certain requisite conditions may be more important than others in determining group decision-making success.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1985.tb00073.x

Results confirmed the hypothesis. Moreover, males were expected to respond to noncompliant persuasive targets with more punishment-oriented strategies than females, and females were expected to use more rewarding strategies to secure compliance from noncompliant persuasive targets.

This investigation used social information processing theory as the basis for a study of antecedents to employee anxiety about a move to an open office environment. The structural equation model developed from social information processing theory proved to be a good fit to the data, and a revised version of the model provided an even belter accounting for the variance in the data. Anxiety about organizational change was determined by social information, individual needs, and job characteristics, with need for privacy having the largest impact on anxiety.

Moreover, most coding research has failed to focus on the relationships between individual tactics and larger communication strategies. This article proposes a coding mechanism sensitive to formal, naturally occurring communication in negotiation settings and capable of identifying strategic use of individual tactics. The coding scheme is then applied to simulated and naturalistic negotiation interaction and the resulting data are assessed, using lag sequential analysis. Significant differences are reflected between the naturalistic and simulated interactions and strong patterns of communication strategy are identified.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1984.tb00025.x

This observation is important given the impact of speech fluency in social perception; however, it raises questions concerning the nature of the processes by which communicative behaviors are prepared and of the representation of those behaviors in the cognitive system. The current research represents an attempt to address these issues. In Experiment I subjects provided with an abstract problem-solution sequence exhibited less silent pausing during speech than a control group which was not given such a sequence. A second experimental group provided with an abstract solution-problem sequence exhibited less pausing than the control group, but not significantly so. In Experiment II, increasing practice with the solution-problem sequence was found to lead a decreasing linear trend in silent pausing. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the nature of production of communicative behavior.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1984.tb00038.x

Forty interviewers (ERs), undergraduates enrolled in a class on interviewing processes, conducted 20–30 minute interviews with selected interviewees (EEs), business persons and professionals in fields of interest to the ERs. Speech behaviors examined included response latency, speech rate, and turn duration; these were coded per one minute intervals of each interaction. Time series regression procedures indicated that both ERs and EEs converged speech rate and response latency toward their interlocutors' performances of these behaviors. Although turn duration convergence did not characterize the entire data set, male-male dyads did converge significantly and male (ER)-female (EE) dyads significantly diverged turn duration. Regarding speech evaluation, there was some evidence that greater response latency similarity, greater speech rate and response latency convergence, and faster ER speech and slower EE speech were positively related to the competence and social attractiveness judgments of participants.

Results indicated that actors elected to make no response when they felt less guilt, when there was no overt reproach, when their instrumental goal (securing honoring) was unimportant, and when the failure event was a severe offense. Concessions were used when the reproachers said nothing or projected a concession, when the offense was severe, when the actors' instrumental goal was important, and when they felt guilty. Actors chose to justify their behavior in high intimate situations where their instrumental goal was less important. Refusal to account was most likely to occur when reproachers used an aggravating reproach form, when actors felt unjustly accused, and when reproachers were dominant.

At three, the most important communicative functions were to verbally master information about the environment (interpretative function) and to express one's needs and ideas (relational function). Interpretative strategies included labelling and elaboration of detail, which enabled children to explore their environment through verbal means. Relational strategies reflected the child's egocentrism since 75% of those strategies were self-emphasizing strategies. At four, a major developmental shift occurred, with the projective function becoming most important, followed by the relational function. Within the projective function, imaginating strategies enabled children to create new roles and contexts for their play. Both imaginating and relational strategies incorporated increasingly adaptive communication directed toward others. Generally it was found that females appeared to develop language strategies (utilized by both sexes) earlier than males, and achieved a more advanced level of cognitive complexity and communicative adaptability in their relational and projective strategies.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1983.tb00687.x

A previous paper defined and measured disqualification as deviations from the direct “I am saying this to you in this situation”—that is, as relative ambiguity in sender, content, receiver, or context. The present article addresses the question of what causes such messages. An interpersonal, situational theory is proposed and tested in a series of five experiments, using a forced-choice among written messages in systematically varied, hypothetical situations. Subjects chose the most disqualified messages overwhelmingly when placed in a “bind.” They did so significantly more than when in a non-bind or a merely unpleasant situation. The last two experiments defined a “bind” as an avoidance-avoidance conflict and showed that disqualified messages were chosen only in these, and not in approach-approach conflicts. The conclusion is that disqualification is not a failure of the communicator, nor even a changeworthy behavior, but a reasonable response to an impossible situation, one that permits the sender to leave the field communicationally.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1983.tb00688.x

A sample of 128 subjects performed a task consisting of solving word puzzles. Subjects' level of IM subsequent to the reception of feedback was operationalized in three ways: amount of time voluntarily spent on word puzzles during a free period and responses made on two IM pencil and paper measures (the TRQ and MSQ). Results indicated that high expertise of the feedback source enhanced IM. Valence alone did not enhance a receiver's level of IM but the data demonstrated an expertise x valence interaction such that subjects receiving positive feedback from a highly expert source exhibited greater levels of IM than did receivers in any other condition.

The results of the Pearson and canonical correlation analyses suggest: the importance of an individual's degree of interpersonal interaction, social activity, life satisfaction, economic security, mobility, and physical health for indicating television usage; a series of interactant associations among contextual age, socio-demographic, viewing pattern, and viewing motivation variables; and the heuristic potential of the contextual age concept for assessing life-position and communication behavior.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1982.tb00666.x

Children ranging in age from 3 years, 5 months to 11 years, 5 months served as subjects. Results of the study suggest that cognitive complexity plays an influential role in the development of children's ability to provide accounts for conversational deviance as well as the ability to provide alternative strategies for the completion of conversations disrupted by improper turn-taking.

Since these children often are denied contact with peers because of their disabilities, it was suggested that they may be unable to develop the perspective-taking ability necessary for adapting communication to a specific listener. It was also suggested that the increased contact provided by moving the handicapped into regular public school classrooms may help alleviate this problem. First-, third-, and sixth-grade children, handicapped and nonhandicapped, with and without the others in their classes, were tested on their listener-adaptation abilities in general and their adaptation to handicapped children, using pictures as stimuli for messages. The results support the hypothesis that handicapped children are deficient in listener adaptation. Classroom association with “normals” seems to improve this, but does not raise them to the level of their nonhandicapped peers. Nonhandicapped children are unable to adapt to handicapped children, and contact with the handicapped does not seem to improve this situation.

The procedures offered here provide a method for determining whether the functions or constructs identified by a coding system are part of the common meanings ascribed to the participants in the interaction. Of the three coding systems evaluated in the study, the IPA System represented subjects' interpretations of decision-making interaction better than the Decision Proposal System, which, in turn, performed better than the Pattern Variable System.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1981.tb00654.x

The original 20-item PRCA was introduced for the purpose of measuring apprehension beyond the traditional public speaking context. Although the PRCA-20 is reliable, some serious criticism of it has centered on its ability to tap interpersonal behavior outcomes. In an attempt to bolster its interpersonal applicability, five “interpersonally-oriented” items were added to form the PRCA-25. The studies reported herein demonstrate that both versions fail to possess sufficient reliable variance to be applicable to contexts other than public settings. In addition, it was found that the interpersonal items are a separate component of the PRCA, and as such, do not justify being treated equal in terms of additivity and, therefore, reduce the construct integrity of the PRCA.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1981.tb00656.x

A definition of rules is first outlined which does not require sole reliance on interpersonal actors’ statements about their behavior or assumptions of communicator self-awareness. Then the paper addresses the intercultural and developmental criticisms directed by Miller (1978) against rules studies. With regard to the former, it is suggested that communications researchers account for (1) the behavior patterns of individuals interacting intraculturally, (2) the culturally patterned attitudes and behavior manifest in intercultural exchanges, and (3) the rule-governed strategies for negotiation. While the paper does not deny the existence of some idiosyncratic behavior, it is suggested that researchers consider rules-based concomitants of relationship developments which are socially patterned in lieu of focusing on relationship-specific (unique) behavior.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1980.tb00549.x

To test derived hypotheses, natural groups from a large organization are identified through communication network analysis on production (n= 17), innovation (n= 16), and maintenance (n= 16) content. As expected, production and innovation groups show relationships between connectivity and attitude-belief uniformity, with production the stronger of the two; maintenance groups show little association, perhaps due to a content definition restricted to interpersonal problems. The predicted positive relationship between connectivity and uniformity occurs for social-emotional variables in the production network. However, unexpectedly in both production and innovation networks personality variables become less uniform as connectivity increases. As suggested, task variables operate differently in association with connectivity in production and innovation networks, although the differences are more pronounced than expected; in production, uniformity on these variables is negatively associated with connectivity, while in innovation they are positively associated.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1980.tb00151.x

Current literature pertaining to communicative competence and literature pertaining to communicator style are reviewed, and an attempt is made to demonstrate their interconnectedness. A precise method for the measurement of communicative/interactive style is described. Subsequently, a study designed to empirically assess the relation between style and perceived attractiveness and communicative effectiveness, in which the above measurement system was employed, is also described. The results indicate that there are at least two interactive styles which are related to two types of perceived attractiveness and effectiveness.

Six viewing motivations were identified: learning, passing time or habit, companionship, escape or forget, arousal, and relaxation. Age was the only demographic correlate of most of these functions. All viewing motivations correlated positively with television viewing levels, medium attachment, and perceived content reality. However, when age and level of viewing were partialed out, habitual viewing was no longer found to correlate with perceived reality. Several significant associations between viewing motivations and program preference were also noted. Arousal viewers preferred dramatic programs, while habitual, escapist, and companionship viewers favored comedies. Habitual viewers also shunned news and public affairs programs.

It is argued that a logical shortcoming of this model of resistance to persuasion is its failure to incorporate the notion of confirmation and disconfirmation of receiver expectations. Support was found for the prediction that violations of induced receiver expectations and the intensity of a persuasive message are mediators of resistance to persuasion. Positive violations of expectations induce counterarguing and lead to reversals of initial positive attitudes after receipt of a second message arguing on the same side of an attitude issue. Negative violations of receiver expectations decrease the probability of counterarguing, and increase the vulnerability of people to subsequent persuasive attacks. Strong support for the predictions was obtained in this investigation. Competing explanations for the results were ruled out through the utilization of a counterbalanced design and control procedures. These results provide a partial replication of the earlier empirical evidence supporting this new model of resistance to persuasion and cannot be explained by other models of resistance to persuasion. Moreover, the findings break new theoretical ground in their explanation of findings that appear counterintuitive without reference to this theoretical rationale.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1979.tb00642.x

From the rules and the definitions of the units of analysis, propositions were derived about the probable location of categories of talk acts in turns and sequences. Theorems and hypotheses were deduced from these propositions. Empirical tests of each of the 16 hypotheses were conducted on transcripts of police-civilian telephone calls, husband-wife decision-making sessions, and selected Watergate transcripts. of 48 possible tests, four could not be made due to lack of data. Forty-three of the remaining 44 were statistically significant. However, 16 tests showed marginal or poor power levels. The data tended to indicate that knowledge of the grammar of conversation permitted significantly better prediction of the occurrence of acts than would be expected by chance.

Although one of the first major literature reviews of this field was produced about 15 years after much of the early foundation research had been completed (Guetzkow, 1965), the next major reviews were published in half the time (Porter & Roberts, 1972; Redding, 1972). As further evidence of the sheer quantity of research being completed in this new discipline, four additional reviews and syntheses were published during the next four years (Pietri et al., 1974; Goldhaber, 1975; Bernstein, 1976; Richetto, 1977). In fact, as Richetto closed his 1976 overview of the field, he predicted that there would “likely be continued attempts at integrating and synthesizing findings” (p. 336). Little did he realize that within two years, three additional reviews would appear (Dennis, Goldhaber, Yates, 1978; Farace, Taylor, Stewart, 1978; Monge, Edwards, Kirste, 1978).

The present synthesis and review, with its emphasis on findings and implications, combines the results of recent North American and European research with those of the first 16 studies completed by the International Communication Association (ICA) Communication Audit. We have divided the review into three major sections: a historical overview of the major findings from both North America and Europe; major findings from the ICA Communication Audit; and implications of all major findings for future research.",2,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1978.tb00624.x

In an experimental design that controlled for time of total exposure to stimulus material and for the time interval between exposure to a test message and later recall and interest tests, subjects viewed a program package consisting of a commercial, a pretested segment of an action-adventure program, and an especially created control in one of four conditions of commercial placement: (1) the commercial was placed between two moderately involving portions of the program which occurred a few minutes prior to both the action-climax and the resolution of the suspense, (2) the commercial was placed immediately subsequent to the highly involving climax and immediately prior to the moderately involving resolution, (3) the commercial was placed subsequent to the climax and immediately subsequent to the resolution, or (4) the commercial was placed between two minimally involving portions of the control communication. Assessments of message recall were taken on one-half of the subjects shortly after they had completed viewing the experimental materials. In order to assess for long-term effects, the remainder of the subjects received a similar recall test and a test of interest in the product depicted in the commercial message one month after the experimental viewing session had been completed. The findings supported the proposition that recall of message content is inversely related to the cognitive involvement potential of the program material presented immediately before and after the critical message.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1978.tb00623.x

Interaction management, empathy, affiliation/support, behavioral flexibility, and social relaxation are identified as components of competence, with interaction management playing a central role. In an experiment designed to partially test the model, 239 Ss were assigned to evaluate a confederate’s role-played communicative competence in one of four interaction management treatment conditions. Results indicated a strong, positive, linear relationship between interaction management and communicative competence. Positive correlations between competence and other components of the model were observed. The competent communicator is thus described as empathic, affinitive and supportive, and relaxed while interacting; he is capable of adapting his behavior as the situation within an encounter changes and as he moves from encounter to encounter. The manner in which the interaction is managed contributes, in part at least, to his fellow interact ants’ perceptions of his competence.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1977.tb00518.x

Representational (motor primacy) movements were more prevalent during the communication of non-person-oriented information (p < .001). Overall, field-dependent encoders produced more continuous body touching movements than field-independents (p < .05).

In Study I, the variables of personalness and valence were manipulated through the use of prototypical disclosure statements with subjects blocked by sex. Subjects were asked to use a scale indicating phases of relationship development to rate when they would likely disclose statements. The analysis revealed significant main effects for all three factors: personal-ness, valence, and gender, as well as a significant interaction between personalness and valence. In Study II, personalness and valence were again manipulated, along with blocking for sex. The variable of disclosure recipient (target) was manipulated by asking subjects to separately indicate whether or not they would disclose each statement to five targets: stranger, acquaintance, parent, friend, and spouse. The analysis revealed significant main effects for three factors: personalness, valence, and target. All possible interactions of these variables were also significant.

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to isolate and define the subconstructs of assertiveness as they emerged from the structure of two assertive inventories—the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule and the College Self Expression Scale; (2) to evaluate assertiveness as a communication construct by examining it in the framework of two measures of communicator style—a Communicator Style Measure and a test of Predispositions toward Verbal Behavior. Results revealed that the assertiveness measures related to the expected subconstructs of communicator style. Assertiveness, as evidenced by low anxiety, dominance, contentiousness, and a refusal to be intimidated by others, correlated highly with measures of verbal intensity, talkativeness, and good communicator style.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00504.x

The survey was described as taking 3 hours (high cost), 1 hour (moderate cost), or 20 minutes (low cost). Following the request for aid, the information seeking and information giving behavior of the subject was coded. As anticipated, the greatest information giving was elicited from non-helpers, especially among subjects in the high cost-high dependency condition.

This formulation also implies that the emotional state or feelings of an individual and the degree of heterogeneity of influences to which he or she was exposed are unrelated to attitude change.

Attitudes and message variables were significant predictors of learning and post favorability. Proactive inhibition produced more interference than retroactive inhibition. Results are discussed in terms of the interrelatedness of the learning and persuasion processes and the ability of interference theory to predict outcomes in both paradigms.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00261.x

In relational communication analysis, the focus is on messages as transactions, and the major theoretic concepts which emerge in this analysis are symmetry, transitory, and complementarity of control. This paper contains a brief review and critique of existing interaction analysis techniques, followed by a detailed discussion of new measurement procedures that capture both the control and processual (time-varying) nature of dyadic interaction. The first step in these procedures yields a code (by speaker) based on the grammatical format of each sequential utterance. The second step yields a translation of each message format and response made into a control code, based on the relationship between the message and its immediate predecessor. These codes are next translated into transactional codes, which can then be analyzed in terms of the three major theoretic concepts. These measurement procedures require minimal subjective judgment, particularly at the initial coding level. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ways we are attempting to operationalize major “themes” or patterns of control in lengthy, ongoing dyadic exchanges.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00270.x

A systemic model of communication process is developed from this which is adduced to account for the ability of communication of specified types to differentially integrate activity and enable affectional expression in the dyad. Development is then conceptualized as the emergence or appearance of those types of communication that can so organize and integrate a dyad to a high degree. A methodological strategy for operationalizing such a scheme is presented in some detail.

Second, sociolinguistics is an unmentioned discipline also studying rules. Third, Cushman and Whiting's concept of communication behavior is too limited. Drawing from semiotics and “behavior exchange,” rules regulating costs and rewards accruing to the communicators from the relationship are shown to be an important part in communication. A search for rules involving meaning will be confounded by concurrent operation of rules involving hedonic outcomes. Fourth, complex patterns of interpersonal communication require the concept of hierarchially ordered contracts, consisting of a few fundamental rules, several sets of rules governing interaction in specific situations, and switching cues used to move from one subset to another.

Now, however, a wide variety of devices and systems can be provided to the consumer of communication services, assuming limited development of the relevant technologies. This requires that choices be made about what is worthwhile pursuing. Since these decisions will shape communication systems for years to come, inputs to the choice process ought to reflect considerations other than just short-run economics and technological feasibility. In particular, these choices ought to reflect societal needs. To assist in evaluating the impact of alternative communication systems on society, we propose three dimensions along which “social” values might be measured. These are: 1) ease of access to stored information, 2) scope of the interaction space common to the communicants, 3) the extent to which provisions exist to take feedback into consideration. The meaning and measurement of each dimension is explored, and a suggestion is made on how they might be applied.

This paper summarizes the contributions of the self-disclosure literature for an understanding of self-disclosing communication. Although this literature is extensive, a considerable portion of it is irrelevant from a communication perspective. Conceptualizations of self-disclosure differ in important ways, making it difficult to compare studies. Further, much of the research studied self-disclosure as a personality trait rather than a process of communication or analyzed exchanges of messages in terms of a linear model of communication. The present study explicates a conceptualization of self-disclosure as an invitation to share experience and communication as an interpersonal transaction. Five generalizations about self-disclosing communication consistent with these conceptualizations are drawn from the literature.

Bernstein's hypothesis of code restrictedness may underlie problems of transforming traditional individuals by affecting the level of empathy which they exhibit when exposed to information about opportunities. Full utilization of language's potentials may be requisite to the perceptual flexibility and cognitive skill with hypotheticals; these in turn may be requisite to effective voluntary change.

The author conclitdes that application of available communication theory calls for programs which change members of “andiences” into participants in meaningful experience.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1971.tb00910.x

In addition, it was found that females rated the picture less socially acceptable than did males, regardless of relative Open– or Closed-Mindedness.

First, the differences found and attributed to channel variation indicate that generalizability of results from the written to the oral situation lacks empirical justification.

Specifically, a category system identified the functions which verbal behavior performs upon tentatively introduced decision proposals and yielded a theory of decision modification within group discussions. Groups do not apparently make decisions gradually by direct amendments but in sudden jumps to different formulations of the same root proposal. That is, proposals were introduced, discussed, dropped, and reintroduced in modified form. Two discernible patterns of decision modification emerged. One pattern involved systematically reformulating the proposal in language at successively lower levels of abstraction until the proposal achieved consensus. The second pattern involved substitute decision proposals at essentially equivalent levels of abstraction until the revised proposal achieved consensus. Unlike previous theories of flight behavior resulting from interpersonal conflict, the present study indicates that periods of task avoidance are inherent within the group process of cumulative decision modification.

Where contextual relevance was low, increasing size of context did not influence perceived magnitude of the core quantity viewed in isolation.

One hundred sixty-two elementary school children from three levels of intelligence comprised the samples. All subjects had mental ages falling in the 9–4 to 11–3 range. The materials used in this study were three standardized listening passages and associated tests. The first two passages were used for training and familiarization purposes; the third passage was used for obtaining criterion data. Multiple choice tests covering the passage contents were used. Two alternate forms of a 28-item test were used with the criterion passage. Immediate and one-week retention data were gathered on each subject. Results of the study indicate that listening rates of 228 to 328 wpm are more efficient for learning and retention than the normal rate of 178 wpm. Subjects with lower IQs performed better at rates which were slower than the most efficient rates for higher IQ subjects. It was further observed that the performance curves obtained in this study display a secondary peak just prior to the final drop in performance at very high listening rates. This study provides evidence that high-speed listening can be an efficient learning medium for elementary school children.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1968.tb00075.x

Indeed, this modern rhetoric has expanded its domain to include the whole range of types of oral communication. But while this very basic kind of evolution has been taking place, it appears that a corresponding ethic (an interpersonal one) has not emerged. The authors make bold to try to stimulate that study.

The interpersonal ethic proposed in the article can be stated as follows: A's communication is ethical to the extent that it accepts B's responses; it is unethical to the extent to which it develops hostility toward B's responses, or in some way tries to subjugate B. The ethic can be observed best, the authors believe, when A discovers that B rejects the message A is sending.

Such an ethic springs from the following assumptions: (1) By virtue of the very nature of the communicative act, the two parties to a communication exercise control over each other. Both the listener and the speaker are, in part, at the other's mercy. (2) One of the highest values in a democratic culture is that conditions be created and maintained in which the potential of the individual is best realized. (3) The individual will be able to realize his potential to the extent that psychological freedom can be increased for him.

An interpersonal ethic, the article suggests, may have more to do with the attitude of the speaker and listener toward each other than with elements of the message (as in the more traditional rhetoric). It may concern itself more with loyalty to the person with whom one is in communication than to rationality or cosmic truth.",4,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1968.tb00057.x

Each of the 36 stimulus tapes was analyzed with respect to distribution of pause-to-phonation time and rate. In addition, the message was analyzed in terms of the Information Theory in an attempt to specify the moment-to-moment textual constraints present.

Comprehension data provided by 135 Ss indicated that pause distribution in a connected message interacts non-additively with rate. Pause-to-phonation ratios in normally accelerated speech decrease logarithmically as speech rate increases and artificial treatment of these ratios produces significant over-all rate increases which survive listening tests better than some random compression treatments.

Methodological considerations are discussed in some detail in an attempt to suggest certain normative measures which would make it possible to more readily compare compression effects across differing messages, speakers and treatments, and as a consequence increase the generality of research findings.",4,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1968.tb00072.x

The persuasive messages used were five print advertisements which had been run quite successfully in mass-circulated magazines in the United States.

Findings suggest that persuasive messages are easier to transfer from one culture to another than is generally supposed. With the audience tested here, it seemed to make little difference whether the source was native or foreign, whether the message was attributed or not, or even whether it was illustrated. There was some support for the hypothesis that a message translated idiomatically is not as effective as one stressing the same point which is composed from scratch in the language of the intended audience.

Data were examined in terms of output, error, equivocation, and recalled (shared) information based upon information theory.

The superiority of the AV treatment was substantiated in all respects of information processing, making less error and equivocation, but recalling more information correctly as compared with the A or V channel. Comparisons between A and V unequivocally established the fact that V made less error but more equivocation, whereas A processed more output information and also made more error; however, there was no significant difference between them in recalled information.

The dependence of A upon constraint was found to be far greater than that of AV whose dependence in turn was greater than that of V.

Certain ancillary data on intelligibility and comprehension were separately obtained from the same subjects by means of a sentence perception task. The results of a multiple regression analysis of test score data indicated that the best predictor of comprehension at high rates of compression was the Best Trend Name Test, originally developed as a measure of the ability to evaluate semantic relations -one of the components in the Guilford structure-of-intellect model of abilities. The outcome of a factor analysis of the test data supported an interpretation that the ability to rapidly match or compare concepts on the basis of semantic relatedness was a determinant of performance on the Best Trend Name Test. In an attempt to account for the significance of this ability in the comprehension of compressed speech, Guilford's concept was juxtaposed with the test or comparison operation postulated to be one stage in the “analysis-by-synthesis” model of speech perception.",1,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1968.tb00071.x

A questionnaire was sent to the above individuals, asking them to; (1) rank-order twelve definitions of communication (from most to least preferred)—this was the denotative phase of the study; (2) rate the concepts “Communication,”“Speech,” and “Persuasion” on three linear-graphic scales (of the Osgood, Suci, Tannenbaum type). The first scale measured the respondents' evaluative feelings of these three concepts (“Good to Bad” continuum). The second scale measured their feelings on the potency of the three concepts (“Strong to Weak” continuum). The third scale measured their orientation of the three concepts as to the complexity or simplicity of the terms when used to describe the process (“Complex to Simple” continuum)—this was the connotative phase of the study.

Results were based on a 41% return (62 of 150); no follow-ups were made to contact the non-respondents.

(2) The profile of mean scores in the connotative phase of the study indicated that respondents evaluated the concept “Communication” to be much better than the concepts “Speech” or “Persuasion.” The mean scores of the oriented activity scales indicated that “Communication” was perceived by the subjects to be “extremely complex,” whereas “Speech” and “Persuasion” were both viewed as being only “moderately complex.” Results from both the denotative and connotative phases of this study strongly suggested that there was much disparity among the respondents' rankings of communication definitions and ratings of concepts.",3,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1968.tb00052.x

A series of contacts between sub-components closes in on itself, thereby enabling the series to repeat itself and thus become a self sustaining process which can serve as a component of a higher order of a structure within the situation.

Or, perhaps it is more accurate to say that science rejects such determinants of human behavior. Similarly, to some persons the idea of being systematic and the idea of being creative seem irreconcilable. Is this always necessary?

The method described does not imply that “great” creative products will necessarily result. However, by using Fisher's factorial notion it is possible to generate a large number of fresh communication messages with this technique. Such messages can be audience-centered, and can be designed for any public medium. A specific example demonstrates how new television program ideas can be created. The ingredients of content and style within the new program ideas are empirically related to recent audience studies, so such programs are expected to maximize the satisfaction for respective segments of the audience.
