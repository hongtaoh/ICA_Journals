Including 106 distinct samples with more than 100,000 respondents, we observed positive cross-sectional relationships between IE and news use, political knowledge, political participation, expressive engagement, and political discussion. These effects shrink substantially but remain significant for panel studies. While we found a stronger relationship with knowledge for experiments compared to surveys, the relationship between IE and discussion and participation was not significant for experiments. Overall, findings suggest that IE matters, but its effects are smaller and more nuanced than previously thought. Also, the effects of IE are strongest when there is congruence between the exposure setting and the outcome setting.

Building on recent research on media effects and developments in statistical modeling, I present a methodological framework to provide a detailed analysis of media effect dynamics. To do so, I describe general patterns for the appearance and the duration of media effects and present statistical approaches to analyze them. Using artificial data, I illustrate how these statistical approaches can be applied to longitudinal data and show how they behave across different data scenarios. Further, extensions, limitations, and the theoretical contribution of the framework to the field of media effects research are discussed. In sum, the presented framework can be used to test various communication theories and can be combined with many research designs in order to identify patterns in the appearance and duration of media effects.</td>\n",

       "4                                                                                         Media effects have been studied for decades. However, it is still unclear how to assess the dynamic nature of media effects methodologically and analytically. Building on recent research on media effects and developments in statistical modeling, I present a methodological framework to provide a detailed analysis of media effect dynamics. To do so, I describe general patterns for the appearance and the duration of media effects and present statistical approaches to analyze them. Using artificial data, I illustrate how these statistical approaches can be applied to longitudinal data and show how they behave across different data scenarios. Further, extensions, limitations, and the theoretical contribution of the framework to the field of media effects research are discussed. In sum, the presented framework can be used to test various communication theories and can be combined with many research designs in order to identify patterns in the appearance and duration of media effects.   \n",

In today’s high-choice media environments, exposure to diverse news is largely determined by individuals’ personal selection. Yet these decisions are increasingly shaped by online platforms, whose curation mechanisms may serve to expand or contract the diversity of encountered content. In a major extension of existing research, we show that positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000 German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant influence.</td>\n",

In this meta-analysis, we analyzed the relationship of IE and five outcomes relevant for democracies. Including 106 distinct samples with more than 100,000 respondents, we observed positive cross-sectional relationships between IE and news use, political knowledge, political participation, expressive engagement, and political discussion. These effects shrink substantially but remain significant for panel studies. While we found a stronger relationship with knowledge for experiments compared to surveys, the relationship between IE and discussion and participation was not significant for experiments. Overall, findings suggest that IE matters, but its effects are smaller and more nuanced than previously thought. Also, the effects of IE are strongest when there is congruence between the exposure setting and the outcome setting. We discuss theoretical and methodological implications for IE research and the field at large.</td>\n",

In a large, probability-based national longitudinal study, we examine the prevalence and consequences of consuming alternative health media (AHM), such as The Dr. Oz Show. Drawing on data from a naturally occurring and time-varying quasi-experiment, we demonstrate that such programming may be able to shift the attitudes of its audience on consequential health topics.

       "1                                                                                                 Diversity is a crucial precondition for a democratic public discourse. In today’s high-choice media environments, exposure to diverse news is largely determined by individuals’ personal selection. Yet these decisions are increasingly shaped by online platforms, whose curation mechanisms may serve to expand or contract the diversity of encountered content. In a major extension of existing research, we show that positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000 German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant influence.   \n",
       "2  In the last two decades, communication research dedicated substantial attention to the effects of incidental exposure (IE) to political information. In this meta-analysis, we analyzed the relationship of IE and five outcomes relevant for democracies. Including 106 distinct samples with more than 100,000 respondents, we observed positive cross-sectional relationships between IE and news use, political knowledge, political participation, expressive engagement, and political discussion. These effects shrink substantially but remain significant for panel studies. While we found a stronger relationship with knowledge for experiments compared to surveys, the relationship between IE and discussion and participation was not significant for experiments. Overall, findings suggest that IE matters, but its effects are smaller and more nuanced than previously thought. Also, the effects of IE are strongest when there is congruence between the exposure setting and the outcome setting. We discuss theoretical and methodological implications for IE research and the field at large.   \n",
       "3                                                                   Cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz, until recently the host of a nationally syndicated U.S. television show, is among the media figures who have espoused health views unsanctioned by established medical authorities such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. In a large, probability-based national longitudinal study, we examine the prevalence and consequences of consuming alternative health media (AHM), such as The Dr. Oz Show. Drawing on data from a naturally occurring and time-varying quasi-experiment, we demonstrate that such programming may be able to shift the attitudes of its audience on consequential health topics. Specifically, Oz’s endorsement of the MMR vaccine was associated with a shift in acceptance among a segment of his audience. Our study demonstrates both the persuasive power of AHM and its capacity to align the views of its low-knowledge audience members with CDC and FDA-consistent science, should its trusted sources choose to do so.   \n",
       "4                                                                                         Media effects have been studied for decades. However, it is still unclear how to assess the dynamic nature of media effects methodologically and analytically. Building on recent research on media effects and developments in statistical modeling, I present a methodological framework to provide a detailed analysis of media effect dynamics. To do so, I describe general patterns for the appearance and the duration of media effects and present statistical approaches to analyze them. Using artificial data, I illustrate how these statistical approaches can be applied to longitudinal data and show how they behave across different data scenarios. Further, extensions, limitations, and the theoretical contribution of the framework to the field of media effects research are discussed. In sum, the presented framework can be used to test various communication theories and can be combined with many research designs in order to identify patterns in the appearance and duration of media effects.   \n",
