    "I used two scripts to gather author data. It seems that there are some differneces. I concluded that the `get-author-df.py` script has some disadvantages. It will not automatically click \"show more authors\" and thus lead to fewers authors in the output. It will take a significant amount of time to check whether this button, i.e., \"show more authors\" exist and then click it. In fact, I am not able to do so because I am using BeautifulSoup, not Selenium!"
