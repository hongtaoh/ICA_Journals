We address this concern by offering a concise definition of NL and suggest five key knowledge and skill domains that comprise this literacy. We distinguish NL from its application to behaviors that communication scholars have been interested in, including news exposure, verification, and identifying misinformation. We propose an adapted Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to include NL in addition to the existing components (attitudes towards the behavior, social norms, perceived behavioral control) when modeling NL Behaviors. We discuss how this model can unite scholars across subfields and propose a research agenda for moving scholarship forward.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtaa005,

This multiple address highlights how the lauded qualities of cult texts are standard in feminine narratives that need to appeal to a large cross section of women. Cult discourse still depends on misogyny and masculinized distinction even when the mainstream mode seems to break down gendered fandom. Contradictions emerge because cult was traditionally defined against the mindless consuming of women. However, the cultish consumption patterns for FSOG are deliberately fostered by merchandising strategies. Thus, the same element that shows cult tendencies is used to denigrate the film as the antithesis of cult: women as consumers.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ccc/tcz017,

In his recent public sphere theory, he classifies different media forms that are necessary for coordinating different types of social action. He identifies three such media forms: linguistic agreement, steering media, and generalized communication. Although communication scholars acknowledge his ideas on linguistic agreement, they have overlooked those on steering media and generalized communication. Accordingly, this analysis focuses more on the latter two media forms, which fall under the broader concept of relief mechanisms. Extending the media theories of Talcott Parsons, Habermas identifies four types of relief mechanisms: money, power, influence, and value commitment. Money and power perform steering media functions that promote efficiency. Influence and value commitment perform generalized communication functions that promote not only efficiency but also understanding. Implications for normative theories of mass-mediated democratic communication are discussed.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00321.x,

This study challenges that supposition by offering a camp reading of Karen Walker (Megan Mullally) from Nbc's Will & Grace (1998–2006).

They produced more and larger gestures when they knew the addressee could see them.

The liberal-pluralist paradigm posits the mass media as a vital conduit of accountability and bottom-up change, whereas the critical paradigm views the news as a crucial site and mechanism of ideological domination. This analysis furthers an evolving ecological approach, which bridges the two dominant paradigms, contending that the same market imperatives and journalistic routines which so often produce news that reinforces the status quo can at times produce news which challenges it. Analysis of news about the environment and waste recycling from 1980–1990 reveals a dramatic shift in coverage patterns following the ill-fated voyage of the Mobro, the garbage barge that sailed the high seas for three months in an unsuccessful search for a port that would accept its cargo. The barge became what we call a news icon: an image that lived on beyond its originating event by being introduced into a variety of subsequent news contexts. The icon provided an occasion for both journalists and their sources to refigure cultural scripts about garbage and recycling. In this process news routines and source communication strategies interacted to produce news as cultural forum, creating opportunities for cultural transformation.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1995.tb00742.x,

Our thesis, informed by concepts that are central to Michel Foucault's antiscience project, is that violence within America's prison system is best understood as an oppositional response to a penological science, which, organized as a set of discursive practices and deployed in an alliance with legal discourses of the political state, succeeds in knowing inmates only in restricted and ultimately self-defeating ways. Our thesis is neutral as to the truth or falsity of the specific knowledge claims of penology. Rather our focus is on the ways in which retrictedness and self-defeat are inherent in the very doing of penology and how, further, the purported successes of penology's discursively grounded knowledge claims, as well as the practices they engender, contribute to the (violent) undoing of those very same claims. We offer illustrative empirical support for our thesis by showing some discursive practices of penological science, how they are deployed specifically in the course of inscribing inmates as scientifically knowable objects, and how such tactics incite inmates to develop new identity resources, steeped in violence, which effectively subvert penology's claims to knowledge.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1996.tb00135.x,

To advance this important literature, we derive two formal propositions from each perspective and test these rival claims in the context of the jury system, the most prominent institutionalized deliberative practice in the United States. Surveys of over 3,000 jurors who served in local courthouses indicate that gender and other demographic differences are poor predictors of jurors’ satisfaction with their service experience, including their perceptions of deliberation. The study also shows that emotion—a dimension of deliberative experience presumed to be gendered—is important for both men and women.

This study examined the collective contributions of a social-cognitive variable (interpersonal construct abstractness) and a motivational variable (emotional empathy) to the production of sensitive comforting strategies. Subjects were 70 college students. It was hypothesized that construct abstractness and emotional empathy would both be positively related to sensitivity of comforting strategies and that these two variables would make a significant independent contribution to the prediction of comforting strategies.

Given these assumptions, it was predicted that the crowding threshold of young adults would be significantly lower than that of older persons. To test this hypothesis, the research varied conversation distance (close, far) and density (small room, large room) and assessed the quality of communicative interaction and task performance among small groups of college-age females and retired women over 60 years of age. Results showed that task performance among younger subjects deteriorated in close interaction conditions, whereas the performance of older subjects was improved by spatial intrusion. Further, older subjects exhibited positive communication behaviors in response to close conversation, high-density conditions, while younger subjects responded either with negative communication behaviors or were unaffected by spatial restriction.

This paper provides such a perspective by outlining in theoretical terms how a cyber-archaeology of virtual communities can be conducted. In archaeology, researchers focus on cultural artifacts. A similar focus on the cultural artifacts of virtual communities should be a focus for CMC researchers as these artifacts can provide an integrative framework for a community's life, be it virtual or real. It is proposed that CMC researchers pursue cyber-archaeology by systematically examining and modeling the framework for virtual community life provided by their cultural artifacts.

The systematic exploration of cyber-space via cyber-archaeology cannot proceed without adequate linguistic tools that allow for taxonomy. The first step in the creation of such a taxonomy is to distinguish between virtual communities and their cyber-place, the virtual settlement. The second, is to define and operationalize the term virtual settlement so that they can be systematically characterized and modeled. With this new terminology, it is possible to detail a cyber-archaeology where technological determinism is replaced with the notion of bounded hierarchies and material behavior. The theoretical outline will show how cultural artifacts can play a role in constraining the forms virtual settlements can sustain. The modeling of the boundaries of virtual settlements via cyber-archaeology should dramatically increase our understanding of communication in general.",2.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00075.x,

All of these studies have depended upon two crucial claims: that laboratory slips are errors of output, and that error-rate differentials are evidence of editing. Recently, however, it has been recognized that neither of these assumptions has been convincingly demonstrated, and consequently the editing models instigated by the earlier studies are being reassessed. The present study tested these two assumptions directly. The output-error assumption was supported by finding larger Galvanic Skin Resistance (GSR) responses for verbal slips than for correct vocalizations. The editing assumption was supported by finding that presumably edited vocal responses (identified by GSR) require more processing time (i.e., vocal response latency) than unedited responses. The reasoning from the empirical observations to conclusions about these assumptions is discussed in detail.

Using panel survey data collected during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we show that positive perceptions of social media indirectly increase offline political participation, through the influence of political expression on social media. However, we find no such positive indirect effects for those with politically diverse networks or for younger people.

This paper outlines and extends a theory of uncertainty management and reviews current theory and research in this area. In addition to the theoretical advances promised by this perspective, the paper describes applications to health communication practice. The drive in disease prevention to reduce uncertainty about the state of health and illness has led to a “culture of chronic illness.” Constant surveillance of people's health, combined with improved methods for screening and monitoring, virtually guarantee finding something wrong with every person, creating a society divided into the chronically ill and the worried well (i.e., those waiting to be diagnosed).",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2001.tb02892.x,

Further, it was speculated that social attractiveness produces obligations to aid the speaker. This experiment tested these claims by predicting that if obligations mediated compliance, social attractiveness would only improve compliance when the speaker benefited from that compliance. In a 5 (Speaker Speech Rate) × 2 (Benefit to Speaker) design, 257 listeners, pretested on their speech rate, were exposed to 1 of 10 requests soliciting volunteers for a bogus research project. As expected, speech rate similarity enhanced social attractiveness, and faster speech rates increased speaker competence and dominance. Social attractiveness had a main effect on compliance, suggesting a direct effect on attraction. Higher sociability/character assessments and lower dominance increased compliance when the speaker benefited more, providing only limited support for the mediating role of obligations. Increased dominance and status also augmented compliance, especially when the speaker benefited less from compliance. Thus speech rate and other nonverbal behaviors may effect compliance by increasing the speaker's social attractiveness, creating obligations to comply, or exerting persuasive force through higher status and power.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1992.tb00303.x,

Drawing on cultural sociology, communication theory, and psychological literature, we introduce the malleability narrative of mediated ideals, described as “a collection of media representations of a variety of ideals that tend to be portrayed as within reach for anyone who is committed to pursuing his/her own self-interest.” The aim of the framework is to foster content analytical research on the occurrence of the malleability narrative in popular media and to stimulate audience research on interactions between media users and the malleability narrative in media, while taking account of different explanatory routes and the heterogeneity of the audience.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtz041,

In this paper I demonstrate that although people play many kinds of games with their nicknames, the nicks they choose are very important to them. They are an inherent part of their Net- identity, and even of their “real-life” identity. Two hundred sixty nicknames were collected from IRC logs, and were analyzed and classified. Only rarely did the IRCers in this study use their real names. The largest category was that of nicks related to the self in some way, referring to character traits, physical appearance, the physiological or psychological state of the self, or the person's profession or hobbies. The list of nicknames and the relative frequency of the different categories illustrate prominent features of electronic culture, a culture in which the individual is placed at the center. Participants in this culture have a high awareness of technology and technological change. They value linguistic virtuosity, yet they show contempt for the rules of the language.

Two experiments uncovered a theoretical mechanism underlying the effect of fact-checking on sharing intentions, and identified an important contextual cue (i.e., social media metrics) that interacts with fact-checking effects. Exposure to fake news with fact-checking information (vs. fake news without fact-checking information) yielded more negative evaluations of the news and a greater belief that others are more influenced by the news than oneself (third-person perception [TPP]). Increased TPP, in turn, led to weaker intentions to share fake news on social media. Fact-checking information also nullified the effect of social media metrics on sharing intentions; without fact-checking information, higher (vs. lower) social media metrics induced greater intentions to share the news.

The current investigation considers: (a) what sender behaviors are associated with receiver suspicion, (b) bow suspicion is displayed overtly by receivers, (c) whether senders recognize suspicion when present, and (d) how suspicion influences sender behavior. Results are reported from an experiment in which interviewees gave varying forms of deceptive answers to interviewers who were or were not induced to be suspicious. Results confirmed that several sender behaviors were associated with receiver suspicion, that receiver suspicion was manifested nonverbally, that deceivers interacting with novice receivers sensed the suspicion, and suspicion altered sender nonverbal displays. However, suspicion often interacted with other communicator factors and deception type to produce complex behavioral patterns. Sender and receiver communication style also were highly correlated, regardless of suspicion level, indicating likely mutual influence. Results underscore the importance of taking communicative features into account and the unlikely prospects of uncovering a generic receiver suspicion display or a suspicion-induced deceiver display that is invariant across relationships and communication contexts.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1996.tb00128.x,

A series of studies undertaken by the World Bank from 1997 to the present suggests that those countries which do not take up to the fullest possible extent the technologies now available and enter what has been termed the ‘Knowledge Economy’ will be ‘left behind’ in the same way as the Third World, which did not experience the industrial revolution. Two of the distinguishing characteristics of the Knowledge Economy, however, are that first, unlike the industrial revolution it does not require the same massive injections of capital into physical plant and R&D, and second, that countries may ‘leapfrog’ into the Knowledge Economy without having gone through industrialization. Many such developing countries (Mauritius is a prime example) have taken that leap and are now functioning effectively in and with cyberspace. However, not all countries are participating equally in this interconnected world and this paper examines one country which has not taken up the challenge of the Knowledge Economy - the Republic of Kiribati which straddles the equator in the heart of the Pacific Ocean. Kiribati is an island nation, and its people are of the sea, with fishing as the mainstay of their subsistence lifestyle. Nets are part of every-day life - but the Net is outside their world. It is suggested that a conservative culture and a paternalistic form of government - itself a reflection of Micronesian cultural values - combine to create an environment where ITC is not pursued actively - or indeed at all. There are significant cultural and socio-political barriers that inhibit the uptake of ITC and some of these factors are explored in this paper.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2002.tb00144.x,

It surveys the scholarly conversation on the politics of American sitcoms, noting how existing research has only provided a partial accounting of conservatism in television comedy. It expands the notion of conservative comedy by considering the sitcom Last Man Standing’s (LMS) place in post-network television, an industry increasingly driven by financialization, corporate consolidation, and the tendency to treat intellectual property—i.e., television shows themselves—as commodities. Finally, it examines several key episodes from LMS centered on property ownership, financial struggle, and precarious labor.

Key requisites of such procedures are presented. These are the establishment of a social-interactive perspective in subjects, the free choice of response configurations by subjects, and the regular provision of clear and unconfounded contextual-criterion events within the social interaction process. A program of research is reviewed in which these recommended experimental procedures were employed to derive functional categories of social influence behavior.

We found that users are continually pigeonholed into racial categories tethered to stereotypes, hierarchizing users such that the Chinese majority are considered more desirable. Users employ race labels to communicate racial membership, circumnavigating Grindr’s preset ethnic categories. Users also creatively appropriate interface affordances to enforce racialized preferences; this includes a preoccupation with verifying racial identities, especially through photos. Racial minorities strategically respond to sexual racism by negotiating for Chinese majority membership, emphasizing the cosmopolitan self over the ethnic self, and/or reframing the situation to disavow victimhood. This research counterbalances the ethnocentric focus of existing sexual racism literature on white-centric contexts by applying sexual fields theory to multiracial East Asia, yielding meaningful theoretical contributions. We also foreground the importance of considering internal dispositions of feelings and attitudes as situated resistance against sexual racism on Grindr.

This article explores how sexual desires of Singaporean users on Grindr (a gay dating app) are socially conditioned to include racial preferences, which in turn constitutes sexual racism. This research is important as it examines the complexities of sexual racism within a multiracial and postcolonial East Asian context, balancing the existing scholarly focus on sexual racism in Western societies. Our interviews with Grindr users in Singapore revealed that users tend to slot themselves (and others) into racial categories that appear fixed and linked to racial stereotypes. This allows a pecking order to emerge, such that the racial majority (Singaporean Chinese users) are generally seen as most desirable. Race is therefore one important dimension of the interactions on Grindr. If racial identity is not immediately obvious on app profiles, users often seek to find out the racial identities of other potential partners by, for example, requesting photos to make guesses about their race. We also studied the responses of racial minorities to sexual racism. These strategies include trying to present a Chinese or Chinese-mixed racial identity, emphasizing an identity that is globalized rather than ethnic, and reframing their situation to disavow their victimhood.",2.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmab003,

In negotiating the boundaries of tradition, Indian women readers construct romance fiction as modern manuals on sexuality that afford them escape from the burdens of preserving the honor of family and community.

One serious design flaw, which involves use of a single message to represent a category of messages, occurs in nearly all of the experimental research on communication effects. The problem with such a design is that an observed difference between categories may reflect only differences between individual, idiosyncratic cases. A related error, the “language-as-fixed-effect fallacy,” involves use of several replications of each category, but analysis of the cases as fixed effects. The consequence is that findings cannot be generalized beyond the sample used. Future research should use multiple cases within each message category studied and treat cases as nested random effects.

The Friedmans’ market public narrowly construes conceptions of knowledge as arising from direct experience and communication as information exchange. Knowledge as direct experience supports the putative universality of self-interest and the sovereignty of individuals as exclusive public actors. Presuming a uniformity of understanding, communication as information exchange dissociates advocates from messages and contributes to the Friedmans’ view of persuasion as an individualistic mode of interaction.

We extend this approach by considering the role of political comedy’s “gateway” effect in encouraging political media consumption, which can promote additional increases in efficacy and participation. This study provides a theoretical synthesis of prior research and a rigorous empirical test using a representative panel survey of adults in the United States, providing evidence of a relationship between political comedy and participation with both news use and internal efficacy serving as mediators.

In keeping with the extended elaboration likelihood model (E-ELM) and the entertainment overcoming resistance model (EORM), we examined how story features, such as narrative transportation and involvement with characters, may reduce three forms of resistance to persuasion—reactance, counterarguing, and perceived invulnerability. In a between-subjects experiment, 367 undergraduates viewed either a dramatic narrative or a nonnarrative program about the difficult consequences of an unplanned teen pregnancy. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing their reactions to the program immediately after viewing and again 2 weeks later. Consistent with predictions derived from the EORM and E-ELM, the dramatic narrative reduced reactance by fostering parasocial interaction with characters and decreasing perceptions of persuasive intent. Also as expected, identification with characters in the narrative reduced counterarguing and increased perceived vulnerability to unplanned pregnancy—although the latter occurred only at the delayed posttest 2 weeks after exposure. Unexpectedly, transportation into the dramatic narrative was associated with greater counterarguing. Taken together, this research demonstrates that investigating narrative influence from the perspective of overcoming resistance is a useful approach.

The results of this investigation extend the scope of inoculation theory to new domain, and at the same time, suggest a new strategic approach for candidates in political campaigns.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1988.tb00172.x,

After viewing the messages, participants provided ratings of dominance, explicitness, and two aspects of affiliation: liking and involvement.

Results were based on more than 70 reports spanning over 40 years of research. Data from 13 countries were located, with attitudinal results from more than 45,000 participants and behavioral results from over 60,000 participants. Pornography consumption was associated with an impersonal approach to sex among both men and women; among both adolescents and adults; and across countries, time, and methods. Mediation results were consistent with the sexual script theory hypothesis that viewing pornography leads to more impersonal sexual attitudes, which in turn increase the likelihood of engaging in impersonal sexual behavior. Confounding analysis did not support the libertarian theory of pornography's hypothesis that the only reason why pornography consumption correlates with impersonal sexual behavior is because people who are already impersonal in their approach to sex are more likely to consume pornography and engage in impersonal sexual acts.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/hcr/hqy014,

Structural equation modeling revealed that, for children in the think-aloud group, both cognitive and affective paths were successful in reducing advertising susceptibility. However, for children in the thought-listing group, only the affective path was successful.

A sample of 366 adult women drawn from a medium-size midwestern city was surveyed by telephone on the issue of mammography use and cancer-related information seeking. The model resulted in an excellent fit to the data received.

Typically, we note and respond to this static aspect of communication and ignore equally important process dimensions. A process approach to communication implies recognition that communication acts are at best approximations of the reality of experience which occurs in and between individuals.

The major thesis of this gaper is that, just as in evolutionary biology, there is no foreseeable end-point in communication. The propensity to treat communicative acts as ends, omitting the fact they are also processes, may be a major barrier to man's ability to communicate with his fellows.",3.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1971.tb00918.x,

Elementary school children (W=172) completed questionnaires measuring viewing, knowledge of, identification with, and the perceived reality of television characters, and ratings of peers on 11 traits (e.g., funny, attractive, kind, nice). Two criterion variables were studied: children's mean rating of peers on each of the traits and the variance in the ratings of peers on each trait. Multiple regression analyses (controlling for grade and sex) revealed that: (1) identification with television characters was a significant predictor of the mean evaluation of peers on the traits; (2) television viewing was a significant predictor of the variance in children's ratings of peers; and (3) the relationship between television viewing and the variance in trait ratings was lower for attributes found in past studies to be suggested by television presentations.

Through an analysis of 82 communication-oriented scholarly works on affordances, we identify 3 inconsistencies regarding the use of this term. First, much research describes a particular affordance without engaging other scholarship addressing that affordance. Second, several studies identify “lists” of affordances without conceptually developing individual affordances within those lists. Third, the affordances perspective is evoked in situations where the purported affordance does not meet commonly accepted definitions. We conclude with a set of criteria to aid scholars in evaluating their assumptions about affordances and to facilitate a more consistent approach to its conceptualization and application.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jcc4.12180,

The hypotheses were tested for differences between African Americans and European Americans with additional tests far relationship closeness. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of the issues and indicated that identity had both political and social dimensions for African Americans but only a single dimension for European Americans.

Ricoeur has rightly argued that this was not the case, as it is obviously possible to use the grammatical third person in order to present the personal thoughts and feelings of somebody else. If one could not do that, it would not be possible to consider “oneself as another.”",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00284.x,

Les effets de l’identité sociale sur l’exposition sélective à des informations concernant des endogroupes et des exogroupes

Des hypothèses ont été testées dans une analyse de données secondaires tirées d’une expérience sur l’exposition sélective à des articles d’information positifs ou négatifs portant sur des individus de même âge ou d’âge différent que soi. Un échantillon de 178 jeunes adultes (18-30 ans) et de 98 adultes plus âgés (50-65 ans) ont parcouru un magazine d’information en ligne alors que leur temps de lecture était enregistré par un logiciel. Les individus plus jeunes (statut élevé, incertitude élevée) ont généralement concentré leur lecture sur les histoires concernant les individus du même âge qu’eux, préférant les nouvelles positives à propos de cet endogroupe. Les participants plus âgés (faible statut et faible incertitude) étaient plus susceptibles de sélectionner des informations négatives à propos des jeunes que des informations positives à propos de cet exogroupe ou que des informations négatives à propos de personnes plus âgées. De plus, l’exposition à des informations négatives concernant les individus plus jeunes a renforcé l’estime de soi chez les participants plus âgés.

Mittels einer Sekundäranalyse von Experimentaldaten zur selektiven Wahrnehmung von positiven und negativen Nachrichtenartikeln über gleichaltrige und jüngere bzw. ältere Personen testeten wir verschiedene Hypothesen. Eine Stichprobe von 178 jungen (18-30 Jahre) und 98 älteren (50-65 Jahre) Erwachsenen las ein Online-Nachrichtenmagazin während ihre Lesezeiten mittels Software mitgeloggt wurde. Jüngere Personen (hoher Status, hohe Unsicherheit) konzentrierten sich beim Lesen eher auf gleichaltrige Personen. Ältere Personen (niedriger Status, niedrige Unsicherheit) wählten häufiger negative Nachrichten über junge Personen als positive Nachrichten über diese Out-Group oder negative Nachrichten über ältere Personen. Außerdem stärkte die Rezeption negativen Nachrichten über jüngere Personen das Selbstbewusstsein der älteren Teilnehmer.

This study identified many of the verbal indices that Blacks use to judge the sincerity of white speakers.

Interviews were conducted with 130 Black people in Pittsburgh, ennsylvania, who were asked to list verbal indices that they use to make the judgment that a given white speaker is insincere. The responses ranged from “One of my best friends is a Negro,” to “I grew up in a Negro neighbourhood,” to “I like you people.” It appears that many white speakers try to show an affinity for Black people and attempt to show an understanding of the Black experience. In so doing, they often simply make the Black auditor even more suspicious of their sincerity. The reason for this is that the verbal index, “you people” is contradictory to an understanding of the Black experience. Other white speakers use stereotypes of Blacks and thereby are perceived as not being sincerely interested in the welfare of Black people.

The results also show that (1) sensation-seeking predispositions and the sexual motive for a pleasurable relationship are indirectly or directly related to all measures of sexual behavior (i.e., number of partners, incidence of unprotected sex, and percentage of condom use); (2) sexual motives driven by concern for health have only an indirect effect on percentage of condom use; and (3) optimistic bias, personal relevance, perceptions about partners, and images of condoms are related to sensation seeking, sexual motives, and sexual behavior. In addition, interpersonal influence from sexual partners appears to both facilitate and inhibit safer sexual behavior.

Firstly, it describes the recycling of traditional Chinese motifs and large-character texts –lanterns, wishes for good fortune in the coming year and so on– from year to year in different combinations to create novel greetings. Secondly, it signifies the increasingly popular practice of incorporating festive symbols from other cultures, such as menorahs and Christmas trees, into the electronic greetings. Through the juxtaposition of traditional and contemporary, borrowed texts, the seemingly disordered pastiches are transformed into uniquely Chinese expressions of celebration. Re-creation and transmission of these greetings also requires a certain degree of technical performance on the part of senders and receivers before they can fully participate in this playful discourse. This paper also discusses how Chinese-language freeware and shareware programs must often be downloaded and locally installed by users before these encoded texts can be translated and displayed in readable Chinese characters. At another level of performance, anonymous Chinese computer artists may use some of these or similar tools to actually design greetings which then have the potential for global distribution and reproduction. “The Ten Thousand-Dimensional Web of Heaven and Net on Earth” (WWW) is quickly becoming an integral feature of many Chinese students' intra-cultural communication, a vast rhetorical surface where one can do anything from peruse a classical novel to select a clever greeting to send to an old friend now halfway around the world.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1995.tb00329.x,

Such findings are apparent at the group level in the analyses of these data; the central, elite groups are characterized by dense linkages and high volumes of social/personal, and work communication. Relational attributions and content data were analyzed in a 2 × 2 table of elite and outsider sources and their judgments of elite and outsider contacts. As expected, elites view one another more favorably (on affect, influence, and receptiveness to new ideas) than they do outsiders. Outsiders also tend to rate elites more favorably in each area than they do other outsiders.

Analyzing panel survey data from the 2016 U.S. election, we find that political expression on social media increases users’ motivations to present themselves as politically active on social media. Political self-presentation motivations are, in turn, positively associated with strengthened dimensions of political self-concepts (i.e., political interest, political self-efficacy, and perceived participation). Findings emphasize the role of expression in shaping political self-concepts, and further hint that this relationship may depend on whether the expressive behavior constitutes a clear, public commitment to a political self-presentation.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqy064,

This pattern of selective exposure based on partisan affinity held not only for news coverage of controversial issues but also for relatively “soft” subjects such as crime and travel.

To better assess whether self-reported attention to content actually measures differential processing of content, an experiment was conducted in the context of media influences on health and safety risk perceptions. A pool of 120 eligible news stories concerning violent crime, car crashes, and other unintentional injuries was randomly selected from a national random sample of such news coverage.

An examination of conflicting narratives within postwar policy debates suggests that the US evaded this path largely because of a concerted backlash—often in the form of red-baiting—encouraged by threatened newspaper and broadcast industries. Many lessons, parallels, and forgotten antecedents for current American media policy can be drawn from the postwar 1940s. Thus, it is instructive to explore how these earlier debates were framed, particularly in response to what might be referred to as “market failure.” Given the worsening journalism crisis and other persistent media policy challenges, this analysis of market failure holds much contemporary relevance.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/comt.12021,

HNA casts hyperlinks between Web sites (or Web pages) as social and communicational ties, applying standard techniques from Social Networks Analysis to this new data source. Webometrics has tended to apply much simpler techniques combined with a more in-depth investigation into the validity of hypotheses about possible interpretations of the results. We conclude that hyperlinks are a highly promising but problematic new source of data that can be mined for previously hidden patterns of information, although much care must be taken in the collection of raw data and in the interpretation of the results. In particular, link creation is an unregulated phenomenon and so it would not be sensible to assume that the meaning of hyperlinks in any given context is evident, without a systematic study of the context of link creation, and of the relationship between link counts, among other measurements.

The contingency variables were quite effective in predicting decision paths and their properties. Group structure variables were stronger predictors than were task variables.

In social judgment theory, ego-involvement makes people more resistant to persuasion, whereas in dual-process models, high-involvement people are susceptible to persuasion when argument quality is high. It is argued that these disparate predictions might be reconciled by either different involvement types (i.e., value relevant vs. outcome relevant) or different attitude modification processes (i.e., attitude change vs. attitude formation). An experiment (N = 684) varying topic, position advocated, outcome relevance, and argument quality tested these moderators. The data were consistent with existence of two different types of involvement, but none of the theoretical predictions were consistent with the data. Instead, a main effect for argument quality had the largest impact on attitude change. Regardless of value-relevant involvement, outcome-relevant involvement, and attitude modification process, participants were more persuaded by high- rather than low-quality arguments, with boomerang effects observed for low-quality arguments.

In Experiment 1, critics who attached praise to the criticism were liked more and agreed with more than were those who did not. In Experiment 2, out-group critics were liked more and aroused less negativity when they acknowledged that the problems they identified in the target group were shared also by their own in-group. In both experiments, the ameliorative effects of praise and acknowledgment were fully mediated by attributions of constructiveness. Experiment 3 tested the strategy of spotlighting; that is, of putting on the record that you intend your comments to apply to just a portion of the group rather than to the whole group.

We analyzed the codes—and the complexity of the sequences—for differences in participants’ judgments of attentiveness toward other-face. Not every accounting form resulted in significant differences; nevertheless, either the speakers or their partners perceived most forms differently in some way.

Most dynamic structure is contained within consecutive dyads. We found a trade-off in the importance of static and dynamic structures, and also found that static structure was predicted more strongly in a stationary process and dynamic structure in a nonstationary process.

We report an online experiment of compliance-gaining conversations with 915 dyads of strangers recruited from Amazon M-Turk. The extent to which two strangers accommodated each other’s non-content linguistic features predicted their behavioral compliance—monetary donation to a charity. This accommodation–compliance link was (a) observed, to some extent, in both conversationalists in the dyads, albeit moderated by seeker–target role differentiation, (b) partially mediated by perceived warmth and competence, and (c) was robust against alternative mechanisms including compliance-gaining strategies, personalities, and demographics. We discuss implications regarding communication-induced influence in mediated conversations and related interpersonal communication processes in general.

How can a fleeting online interaction bring about compliance, especially for prosocial causes such as charity donation? This article finds that compliance is increased when there is a legacy of cooperative interactions (i.e., successful interaction rituals) on the part of all conversation partners—not just the one who seeks compliance. Such interaction can be identified when the individuals start to coordinate and accommodate each other’s language use (e.g., using similar expressions or adopting similar linguistic styles). The research shows that since online conversations often rely on text-based communication that lacks other channels with which to signal cooperative interactions, coordinated language plays an important role in gaining compliance.",2.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmab001,

Central to applying an EV framework to touch is assessing the expectedness, interpretations, and evaluations of touch and its influence on such communication outcomes as evaluations of communicator attractiveness and credibility. To address these considerations, an experiment required participants to engage in dyadic problem-solving discussions during which they were touched or not touched by high-valence (attractive, high status, expert) or low-valence (unattractive, low status, inexpert) confederates. Brief touches by high-valence communicators were less expected than from low-valence communicators but positively evaluated from both. Touch also carried many favorable relational message interpretations, and the combination of touch and high communicator valence generally produced the highest credibility and attraction ratings. Some gender effects emerged, which appeared to moderate touch effects.

These message types were presented in a repeated-measures design, rotated across three well-known brands, and interspersed with distractor posts. Results indicated that the three message types produced similar effects on ad attitude, brand attitude, and behavioral intention.

We found that a Gaussian distribution function explained the explicit media priming effect (i.e., decay in effect size at very high dose levels).

Making gambling more broadly available via the networks threatens heightened crime, an increased incidence of compulsive gambling, and cannibalized spending in other areas of the economy. Yet, U.S. state and federal laws are inadequate to deal with the onslaught of virtual gaming. States are unlikely to be able to prosecute out of state casino operators operating in cyberspace. Although they may be able to prosecute their own citizens for gambling on-line, enforcement will be difficult. Federal statutes may criminalize cyberspace casinos, but the U.S. government's ability to prosecute foreign operators is questionable. As existing legal frameworks prove inadequate to deal with a global, intangible entity, new legal, technological, and political solutions will have to be crafted in order to protect Americans from the substantial externalities posed by on-line gambling.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1996.tb00054.x,

While CMC and information and communication technologies (ICTs) have had positive catalytic affects among the majority Jewish population of Israel, there have been distinct changes in the use of CMC and ICTs among the Palestinian Israeli1 minority in Israel which serve to maintain the existing political and social disenfranchisement of this group within the larger Israeli society. In addition, this paper discusses the resulting creation of a regional public sphere, beyond the boundaries of the Israeli State, in part as a result of the violent conflict of the past two years. This regional public sphere, unique to Palestinian Israelis, serves to further distance the Palestinian Israeli minority from mainstream discourse and influence within Israel.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2003.tb00206.x,

These works suggest that users’ interactions can lead to cyberbalkanization when interlocutors form homophilous communities that typically have few connections to others with opposing ideologies. Yet, rather than assuming communities are isolated, this study examines community-level interactions to reveal how communities in online discourses are more interdependent than previously theorized. Specifically, we examine how such interactions influence the evolution of topics overtime in source and target communities. Our analysis found that (a) the size of a source community (the community that initiates interactions) and a target community (the community that receives interactions), (b) the stability of the source community, and (c) the volume of mentions from a source community to a target community predicts the level of influence one community has on another’s discussion topics. We argue this has significant theoretical and practical implications.

Political discussions online, especially those in the United States, seem to range between harmonious discussions of likeminded people and heated debates that end with few, if any, who have changed their minds. Researchers have often examined these balkanized/polarized situations by studying online communities as isolated echo chambers of opinion. Our study focuses on the interactions between online communities who have different worldviews. We examine communities engaged in the global refugee crisis. We consider how the inter-community interactions influence the agenda of the respective communities. Our longitudinal analysis on the one hand confirms previous studies, namely that intra-community interactions indeed resemble echo chambers. On the other hand, we also find that there is interdependence in the inter-community discussion topics, albeit some communities had greater influence on other communities’ discussion topics. For example, larger, more stable communities command more influence.",2.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmab002,

Findings have implications for: (a) the theoretic relationship between verbal and nonverbal behavior in terms of social meaning, (b) what it means to explain transitions and reduce patients' uncertainty, (c) the organization of physician-patient interaction, and (d) the relationship and interface between macro- and microconceptualization of context.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00782.x,

In the organizing process theory tradition, values are recognized as important elements guiding organizational sense making or emerging through organizing or learning, but amazingly diverse and unintegrated social structures can stand as resolutions (broadly defined) of integration problems.

Results showed how public attention to inequality was constructed through pulling and pushing interpretive frames between the core and periphery of dense communication networks.

In this study, we specifically focus on information pools that create a public good. Following current theory and research, we argue that extremely low costs of contribution combined with very large networks of distribution facilitate the production of online information pools—despite an abundance of free-riding behavior. This paper presents results from a series of Internet field experiments that examine the effects of various feedback mechanisms on repeat contributions to an information pool. We demonstrate that the social psychological benefits from gratitude, historical reminders of past behavior, and ranking of one’s contributions relative to those of others can significantly increase repeat contributions.

A general description of the model is presented and then applied specifically to the task of creating effective cancer communication messages by asking the following questions about cancer communication: (a) What is the goal of the message? (b) Who is in the target market? (c) What medium will carry the message? and (d) What is the motivational and personal relevance of the main information in the message for the majority of people in the target market? The paper concludes that cancer is a motivationally relevant topic that will elicit aversive activation. Target markets for various types of cancer-related messages (e.g., smokers or people of a certain age) will process mediated messages in predictably different ways making certain design decisions better for certain target markets. Both structural and content elements of messages interact with the limited capacity information processing system to impact resource allocation, which in turn determines how well messages are encoded, stored, and retrieved at a decision point. Individual differences in peoples’ motivational activation influence both their tendencies to engage in risky behaviors that increase the probabilities of getting cancer and their processing of health-related messages. Future research from this perspective should be done to optimize cancer messages for specific target audiences using specific media.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00283.x,

Study 1 confirmed a correlation between students' third-person effect perceptions and opposition to publishing the advertisement. Jewish students produced larger third-person effects and were significantly less willing to print the advertisement. These results suggest that those with interests at stake perceived the message as especially likely to influence others, and thus dangerous.

Results from the analysis of 3000 messages, obtained from a diverse sampling of computer-mediated discussion groups and forums, provided support for the primary hypothesized relationship. A speaker's emotional involvement was significantly and curvilinearly related to two message framing devices (message dependency and coalition building) and a measure of conciliatory face-saving moves.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00193.x,

The group is identified as alternately exemplifying and challenging neoliberal logic and the article considers the relationship between neoliberalism and different forms of cosmopolitanism.

Such a distinction is useful for conducting inquiry on communicative practices in authoritarian regimes, where the advent of the dialogical is evident in dissident acts that phrase damages and wrongs in the face of authorities who attempt to cancel the debt of these “differends.” Rather than pitting partisans of dialogue against partisans of agonistics, or discussing ways in which dialogue draws upon agonistics for rational argumentation or relational development, the author proposes that thinking about and engaging dialogue under authoritarian social, political, and economic constraints is impossible without agony, demanding time, respect, sorrow, outrage, and a feeling for the sublime (pain, pleasure, and their mix).

Although surgeons commonly launched the beginning with an announcement of the pathology report as the reason for the consultation, we found that in VMC, “how are you?” was regularly inserted after the testing of the technology. The question is a suitable strategy, as it displays overt other-attentiveness, while also being medically relevant.

The importance of the relational history among participants in any conversation is stressed as a major influence on the understanding necessary for conversation to be coherent. Theorists of communication are urged to attend to the history existing among participants in interpersonal communication.

Feminist critiques of reproductive technologies provide emancipatory criteria for judging new technologies. Both standards, those of appropriateness to a specific realm and those of emancipation, are necessary to judge the selection of “choice” as the descriptor of technologies that will most likely narrow women's choices as individuils and a group.

Specifically, it was hypothesized that courteous service would influence customer evaluations and mood, which, in turn, would influence CDBs. Observational and survey data were collected in two grocery stores. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that courteous service had an indirect influence on customer commitment behaviors. Specifically, as cashiers displayed more courtesy, customers provided more positive evaluations of service and were ultimately more likely to recommend the store to friends and shop at the store if other stores are closer. However, courteous service did not predict customer helpfulness. Courtesy also explained relatively little variation overall in outcome variables. Therefore, efforts to improve customer outcomes should extend beyond improving the courtesy of service.

The problem of mathematical description of such a process is quite difficult because this process transcends the mechanics of signaling. The theory of games, which analyzes interactions in terms of their outcomes, is proposed as an alternative mathematical description.

The assumptions necessary for such description are (1) that most communication is purposeful activity occuring between at least two participants, (2) that the participants in this process have goals that are observable and measurable, (3) that the interaction of maximum value to participants represents the goal of ideal communication. Granting these assumptions, then communication can be described in terms of an array of outcomes or a matrix which can be “solved” by means of the theory of games.

For example, the blogs tied with the Uri party have a higher centrality and are more densely connected. Network diagrams also suggest that the top blogs are polarized by party. However, some blogs are located at the center of the Uri and GNP clusters and are connected to both camps.

The indirect effect occurs when an individual’s perceived utility of counter-attitudinal information is at a high and a middle level, but not at a low level.

Given the shortage of empirically based knowledge about what constitute expected and unexpected interpersonal behaviors and how they are evaluated, a two-part experiment was conducted to determine the expectedness and evaluation of three nonverbal variables: touch, conversational distance, and posture. The possible moderating effects of communicator attractiveness, status, and gender were also examined. Respondents (N = 622) viewed photographs of an attractive or unattractive male or female stimulus interacting with a male or female partner, attributed to be of same, higher, or lower status, who displayed one of seven forms of touch or one of nine combinations of posture and proximity. Respondents rated the appropriateness, typicality, and desirability of the observed behavior. Results demonstrated that several behaviors are expected and positively valenced, while others qualify as positive or negative violations of expectations. Attractiveness influenced expectancies and evaluations; gender and status had limited effects.

Relationship members who have achieved this type of bond are referred to as symbolically interdependent. The remainder of the article presents results of a study of the relationships between symbolic interdependence and time spent talking in groups of premarital couples that were either separated geographically or living in close proximity.

This paper adopts the proposition that values have a pivotal role in the analysis and design of health communication interventions and that analyses that focus on values embedded in the intervention process can contribute to theory development. Instead of focusing exclusively on health-related objectives, the paper proposes that analyses can also examine the extent to which certain values might have contributed to both problem definition and intervention strategies. The rationale for focusing on values, distinctions between a strategic and a value-centered approach, and the importance of ethical issues in the analysis of health communication interventions are presented through a series of eight propositions.

Based on an online survey of 542 respondents, four categories of interactive features were identified. Findings show that interactive features are generally used infrequently, especially the features that facilitate human-to-human communication and the features that allow audiences to express their views. Regression analyses show that different user characteristics and backgrounds predict the use of specific types of interactive features. This study illustrates that news organizations need not worry about applying all types of interactive features to engage their readers as the features serve distinct functions. Instead, news organizations should focus on building credibility and may seek to identify their online news audiences and then subsequently provide interactive features accordingly.

This study examines the role that closeness plays in mediating young adults' (n= 220) stereotypes of older adults. Consistently, young adults rate their closest grandparent more positively on exhibiting stereotypic behaviors and communicative ability than they do their least close grandparent. Although the grandparent's age does not influence the level of reported closeness, the level of closeness does influence perceptions of the older individual's behavior and abilities. Although closeness does mediate young adults' stereotypes of older adults, it does not preclude them from providing negative evaluations of some older individuals who are well-known to them.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2002.tb02570.x,

Wright’s model of same-sex friendships is proposed as more adequate than simple affection as a conceptualization of interpersonal relationships, and an adapted form of Chaffee and McLeod’s coorientational paradigm is employed as a model of reciprocated disclosure. The hypotheses that affection accounts for less variance in disclosure than other criteria of friendship and that disclosure varies as a function of perceived rather than actual similarity were strongly supported. Although male and female subjects disclosed differently, hypotheses about sex differences in disclosure were not supported, failing to replicate previous findings.

Subjects were either exposed to a two-hour videotape portraying violence against women or to exciting, nonviolent material (i.e., auto races, nonviolent sex). Following this, all subjects were exposed to two brief clips of violence perpetrated by a man against a women. During these clips, all subjects’ heart rates were monitored.

Much of that focused on sex and spectacle, but early tabloid coverage of Trump was also surprisingly political, with speculation about a possible presidential campaign beginning as early as 1987. Although that coverage has been largely overlooked, this study reveals that tabloid media played a central role in building the foundations of Trump’s political identity. It tracks the early articulation of the Trump character and its simultaneous politicization within a media space outside the ostensibly legitimate arena of institutional public-affairs journalism. In so doing, it reveals the deeper contours of an imagined political world in which a Trump presidency could be conceivable in the first instance—a political imaginary adjacent to the deep assumptions of liberal Democracy, and therefore long invisible to most serious observers of presidential politics.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqz022,

Thought is the autonomous production of a psychic system. Communication is the autonomous production of a social system. The relationship between psychic systems and social systems can be defined as “structural coupling.” Such a coupling is realized in two steps. First, a single communication and a single thought happen simultaneously, and this allows the indiuidual to think what he or she is understanding in communication. In this way, commuiaicon forms (social structures) may perturb a psychic system. Second, meaningful information about the perturbing social structures is produced in the psychic system, depending on psychic structures. Thanks to this autonomous production of meaning, a psychic system can be unique. It is necessary to describe both the structural coupling and the two different kinds of coupled structures; the social structures shaping the perturbing communication and the psychic structures shaping the meaning of this perturbation. The communication theory called coordinated management of meaning (CMM) provides an interesting description of the effects of structural coupling for individuals. The theory of structural coupling seems a promising way to explain how individual autonomy can be based on communication, avoiding harsh debates between individualism and collectivism.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1993.tb00061.x,

Results from regression and path analyses indicate that, although overall television viewing has a negative association with idealistic marriage expectations, viewing of romantic genre programming (e.g., romantic comedies, soap operas) was positively associated with idealistic expectations about marriage. Further, a strong and positive association between these expectations and marital intentions was evidenced.

While psychological formulations are helpful in generating constructs and propositions dealing with intrasource effects as a function of counterattitudinal advocacy, the generalizability of these findings appears limited. Berger’s role enactment model of persuasion provides constructs and propositions that comport more exactly with practical communicative experiences. The present study tested the relationships obtaining among concepts crucial to the model. Results confirmed the prediction that role aptitude and task-relevant information were positively related to attitude change. The relationship among the role aptitude, information, and post-performance evaluation variables was not confirmed. The results and refinements of the model were discussed in terms of the potential the model has for more precise tests of communication effects. Message complexity, varying information levels, and other variables were discussed as amenable to tests employing the role enactment model.

While self-persuasion situations offer an appropriate paradigm in which to test general social psychology theories, there is some doubt as to the contribution such research can make to our understanding of communication. It is a question of “social significance.” Do sources frequently speak against their “true” attitudes? If so, do intra-source effects tell us much about communication between people? In short, can practical gains be achieved in counterattitudinal advocacy research? We believe that many of the processes associated with self-persuasion are similar to those which characterize interpersonal communication. These similarities are most obvious when one approaches communication research in the context of role theory. (1972, 260)",2.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00493.x,

Journalistic roles are articulated and enacted on 2 distinct levels: role orientations (normative and cognitive roles) and role performance (practiced and narrated roles).

The study probed the relationship between threat and involvement, their role in inoculation, and the nature of cognitive processes triggered via inoculation. The pattern of results suggests that inoculation elicits threat, threat contributes to resistance, and resistance is most pronounced for more involved receivers and on behalf of more involving topics. Finally, the results shed additional light on the process of inoculation but revealed a process considerably more intricate than was initially predicted. Structural equation analyses indicated that inoculation and involvement exert parallel, but independent, effects throughout the process of resistance. Both contributed directly to resistance, and both indirectly furthered resistance, but along unique paths. Whereas inoculation elicited receiver threat, which indirectly enhanced resistance through its sizable and immediate impact on Phase 2 attitudes, involvement contributed to the process of counterarguing and, thus, exerted a delayed indirect impact on Phase 3 attitudes.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00413.x,

Formal models for both perspectives are presented as a means of bracketing discussion of the role of communication processes in group outcomes. The implications of these models for future theorizing are discussed. The first of these two models is an extension of Hewes’s socioegocentric model (1986, 1996). The second class of formal model, dual-level connectionist models, integrates mental and communication processes to explain moment-by-moment communication behavior. This class of models is contrasted with important models of group influence that use atemporal aggregations of messages to predict group outcomes.

We find widespread pluralistic ignorance: QRPs are generally rejected, but researchers believe they are prevalent. At the same time, we find optimism about the use of open science practices. In all, our study has implications for theories in communication that rely upon a cumulative body of empirical work: these theories are negatively affected by QRPs but can gain credibility if based upon ORPs.

The research focuses on what characterizes this community, and how students define and maintain community while largely restricted to communication through media that have been viewed as unsuitable for the maintenance of close social bonds. Interviews conducted over a year with 17 students reveal the importance of community and its role in supporting them in their “different kind of world” and important temporal and technological dimensions associated with community development. Each cohort begins in physical proximity with an intensive, on-campus “boot camp” that acts as a lasting bonding experience. When students return home, they reinvent this physical proximity as virtual proximity, appropriating technology and the opportunities afforded them by class and program structures to socialize and work with people they met on-campus. They enjoy the temporal proximity of “live” lectures and appropriate Internet Relay Chat's “whispering” facility to socialize; they make near-synchronous use of email, and use the timing of assignment submission to initiate email exchanges. Those who fail to make such connections feel isolated and more stressed than those who are more active in the community. Recommendations include promoting initial bonding, monitoring and supporting continued interaction and participation, and providing multiple means of communication to support the need to engage in work and social interaction, both publicly and privately. Overall, our interviews show that belonging to a community brings benefits to the individuals and to the program, and supports efforts by educators who strive to provide such a community for their distance learners.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00114.x,

We traced the top 100 templates in meme generators in English, German, Spanish, and Chinese, using 10 examples to typify each (n = 4000). Combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, we examined the forms, social identities, and emotions embedded in these templates. Our findings demonstrated that whereas meme templates are dominated by American/Western pop culture, local templates are also evident, especially in Chinese. Overall, memes are socially conservative yet emotionally disruptive; while they align with hegemonic representation patterns, their emotional palette tilts toward the negative, with anger as a major anchor and happiness expressed ironically. Finally, our findings suggested an individualism–collectivism puzzle, wherein emotions in memes seem to contradict the existing literature on cultural values.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmy016,

To demonstrate the relevance of these insights and to stimulate the engagement of communication researchers with them, this article is organized around two purposes. First, the transformative strand of complexity science is identified and its paradigm of causality is explained so that we might discover its potential significance for communication research. Second, the fruitfulness of using transformative insights as source analogies to reconceptualize communicative interaction is explored through a consideration of six research shifts warranted by these insights.

Additionally, we control for confounders such as TV use, self-esteem, and satisfaction with friends. We found that frequency of Internet use in general and use of SNS in particular is not substantially related subjective well-being. The explanatory power of general Internet use or SNS use to predict between-person differences or within-person change in subjective well-being is close to zero.

Moreover, Obama and Romney supporters relied on their politically affiliated horizontal media more than their opposing party's media. Evidence for findings are provided through the NAS model, which measures the agenda-setting effect not in terms of issue frequency alone, but also in terms of the interconnections and relationships issues inside of an agenda.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jcom.12089,

We also contend that Levine et al.'s measurement studies do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that there are problems with the validity of the scales (e.g., there may be multiple dimensions that form independent and interdependent self construals in second-order factor analyses). We summarize other evidence for the construct validity of self construal scales which indicates that there are theoretically consistent findings across approximately 50 studies using the 3 scales. This would not be possible if there were major problems with the 2-dimensional model of self construals or the scales used to measure them.

This analysis is grounded in feminism and used to critique the recent focus on ethnography as literary form. I argue that in valorizing ethnographer-authors as individualized personas and psyches, this formalism both directs attention away from research subjects and what they are trying to say, and fails to account adequately for the political subjectivities of researchers. Ultimately I argue that the kind of political accounting I call for is as necessary for feminism as for other analytic standpoints if we are to come to terms with how theory and methodology preserve and extend social and cultural hierarchies.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1992.tb00038.x,

College students described how they would request a date from a member of the opposite sex and how they would ingratiate themselves to a new roommate. Each plan was judged for its effectiveness (i.e., likelihood of success) and analyzed for the types of actions represented within it. As hypothesized, loneliness and shyness were inversely related to plan effectiveness in the date-requesting domain for males but not for females.

Most previous research on Structuration in groups and organizations used qualitative case studies because Structuration is quite complex. This study introduces a method for the study of Structuration in larger samples of groups or organizations. A category system for the identification of structuring moves is described, along with several methods for characterizing short- and long-term trends in Structuration processes. The method is used to study how groups incorporate a computerized group decision support system (GDSS) into their decision processes. GDSSs are part of a class of new computer and communication technologies designed to help groups improve their meetings and make better decisions. Because GDSSs must be used by a group rather than an individual, social processes are critical in determining their effects on group outcomes. GDSSs influence groups by structuring their activities, and structurational processes are critical mediators of the impacts of GDSSs on group decision making. The study focused on the effects of restrictiveness of GDSS technology on Structuration processes and, in turn, on the relation of Structuration to a key group outcome, consensus change. The results suggest that two major types of structuring processes occur in computer-supported groups and that the nature of structuration is related to degree of consensus change.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1992.tb00294.x,

Cultivation effects remain stable over the decades, implying an enduring relationship between television’s message system and viewers’ conceptions of social reality, despite immense changes in the institutional structure and technology of television. That bolsters a “traditional” perspective on cultivation, which is further corroborated by a stronger positive effect of overall viewing compared with genre viewing. However, this (stronger) effect weakens over time, which provides at least partial support for a “reformist” perspective on cultivation.

Complexity is defined logically, as well as linguistically and cognitively. For the three sets of materials used here, one excerpt was simple lexically, syntactically, and ideologically. The second was complex lexically and syntactically, but was constructed to contain precisely the same ideas and theme as the first. The third excerpt was simple lexically and ideologically, but was complex syntactically.

The data were analyzed linguistically in traditional ways and cognitively for ideas, signals, total cognitive units, for omissions, distortions, and for additions of units. In general, listening, like speaking, seems to be freer from the stimulus and more prone to distort the material it conveys. Like speaking, listening seems to be a looser and less inhibited modality. It seems to be a more direct and less complicated process and a modality that is “more in tune” with thought processes as they occur naturally, than does reading.",2.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1968.tb00053.x,

Results suggest the prevalence of violence has increased slightly, but the number of programs saturated with violence has experienced a more significant increase. This appears to be driven by an influx of highly violent movies airing in primetime on cable channels. Although some contextual variables suggest slight improvements in terms of negative consequences for violence, the overwhelming majority of violent television programs and movies do not feature anti-violence themes.

People tend to ascribe higher credibility to messages that they repeatedly encounter. In contrast, the second effect occurs when repetition is taken too far. Here, an indirect and negative effect is identified and participants start to perceive the message as a persuasive attempt.

The informativeness explanation of the negativity effect posits that the evaluative extremity (the distance from a psychological neutral point) and evaluative valence (positive/negative) of an event serve as determinants of its informativeness. Traditionally, this informativeness hypothesis explains the occurrence of a negativity effect by presuming a skewed distribution with unequal tails for the frequency of outcomes for valence; a mirror-image distribution for informativeness as a function of valence; and a negative, linear relationship between typicality and informativeness. These three assumptions were tested directly in this research through the fitting of nonlinear equations. It was determined that (a) a negatively skewed distribution of outcomes for valence does not occur in interaction contexts and that (b) typicality was a determinant of informativeness, although its importance as a determinant varies in response to whether one's perspective is that of an observer or a participant. Thus, reliance on evaluative extremity and evaluative valence as determinants of informativeness was rejected; these variables are only descriptors when the distribution for the frequency of outcomes for valence is skewed and has uneven tails.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1989.tb00208.x,

The results show that the masculinity or femininity (lack of androgyny) of an avatar, as well as anthropomorphism, significantly influence perceptions of avatars. Further, more anthropomorphic avatars were perceived to be more attractive and credible, and people were more likely to choose to be represented by them.

We further draw on emerging scholarship on encounters with data in the everyday to discuss how audience agency is now challenged by datafication, arguing that communicative agency is increasingly prospective in a datafied age.

The stepfamilies, regardless of their strength, faced 7 primary challenges in their development: “feeling caught,” regulating boundaries with a noncustodial family, ambiguity of parental roles, “traumatic bonding,” vying for resources, discrepancies in conflict management styles, and building solidarity as a family unit. However, the communicative tactics used to manage them differed according to the strength of the stepfamily. In general, strong stepfamilies reported using everyday talk, more openness, spending time together as a family, communicating clear rules and boundaries, engaging in family problem solving, promoting a positive image of the noncustodial parent, and more consistency in perceptions about the severity of their problems.

From the citizens' perspective, the demand for greater political participation is usually related to the expectation of being able to influence the decisions taken by the government or the administrative systems more effectively (Fuchs, GuidoRossi, & Svensson, 1998, p. 324). Recently, this idea also became applifable to the new digital, interactive practices which have formed on the basis of the new computer or electronic networks. The realization of participatory potentials of new computer technologies is often presented and expected in the “images of electronic democracy” as a more direct democratic model (Barber, 1984; Budge, 1996; Grossman, 1995). In general, the more direct forms of democracy presuppose that a) computer technology is easy to use, accessible to all and interactive; b) that the usage of technology enriches a “good citizen” and that c) with the help of technology more active involvement in the decision-making process develops. This paper seeks to explain the main obstacles which discourage Internet users from more direct involvement in political life and to explore the possibilities for the revitalization of more interactive, more open political engagement. Computer-mediated communication is an excellent starting point for expanding and strengthening participation in political processes, but the solution is not in technology, as the reason for mostly negative answers to such dilemmas are not questions of “technological inadequacy”. The problems and obstacles lie primarily in the politics that stimulate the use of technological potentials.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2003.tb00211.x,

Through a case study of Black Lives Matter 5280 (BLM5280), I argue that although counter-surveillance tactics such as “cop-watching” and video activism illuminate law enforcement misconduct and elevate the discourse of social movements, the preemptive suppression of dissent by privatized and militarized police agencies creates an asymmetry between state surveillance and counter-surveillance that limits the efficacy of video evidence.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ccc/tcy013,

Through a quantitative analysis of over 11,000 Wikipedia articles, we provide an evaluation of two popular feminist interventions designed to counteract gender inequality within digital information projects.

Results of two experiments indicate that eudaimonic forms of emotional involvement (characterized by negative valence, moderate arousal, and feeling moved) stimulated reflective thoughts about politically relevant content, issue interest, and information seeking.

As a first test of whether separate profiles exist for negatively, as opposed to positively or neutrally, valenced arousal, data are analyzed from a mock-interview experiment in which, following a baseline interview, participants (N=52) were subjected by an interviewer to either increased or decreased involvement. The involvement changes were expected to elevate arousal intensity for all participants and induce positively or negatively valenced arousal in the two respective conditions. Polynomial regressions and z-test comparisons of correlations revealed that 16 composites, comprising a total of 47 nonverbal variables, showed significant associations with changes in arousal.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1989.tb00210.x,

It was hypothesized that for immigrants to be engaged in diverse communication patterns requires both a greater social capacity and a greater cognitive capacity. The cognitive structure with which immigrants process information from their new environment, and their perceived locus of control over the environment, were used as measures of cognitive capacity.

To test this, we conducted a multi-team experiment of 62 teams embedded in a virtual world where their primary objective was to coordinate an attack on a group of insurgents.

Despite its promise, the contact hypothesis appears to suffer from three major defects: (1) practicality—creating a contact situation involves overcoming some serious practical obstacles; (2) anxiety—the anxiety felt by the participants may cause a contact to be unsuccessful or at least not reach its potential; (3) generalization—the results of a contact, however sucessful, tend to to be limited to the context of the meeting and to the participants.

This article then discusses the potential reasons for this finding including how TTPs strategically solicit firms and why trusted firms may be more likely to be embedded.

Results confirmed deleterious effects of non-contingency on outcomes. Contingency moderated latency effects. Mediation analyses showed indirect effects of contingency via interpersonal judgments on organization/customer relations. Implications for a more comprehensive approach to SIP conclude the study.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmy009,

To develop such a model, we start with the planned risk information-seeking model (PRISM) and explore its tenets, and related research, as they apply to information avoidance. We end with a theoretically sound planned risk information avoidance (PRIA) model and accompanying propositions in three overarching areas: cognitive, affective and socio-cultural.

For instance, television news producers appear to believe that young viewers can attend to weather icons, lexical news crawls, and sports scores while they also attend to news anchors who present the news. Nonetheless, attention theory suggests parallel processing on this scale cannot be executed efficiently. Given the format's popularity, perhaps those messages take advantage of perceptual grouping, as described by Treisman, Kahneman, and Burkell (1983). Perceptual grouping describes a process where separate but semantically related messages are attended to simultaneously with minimal effort. Using secondary task methodology, we measured participants' attentional capacity while they watched an example of this format: CNN's Headline News. In addition to this visually complex condition, we created a visually simple condition by deleting graphics and news crawls. Participants in this latter condition attended to both the auditory and visual channels, thus retaining story facts conveyed by both channels. Participants in the complex condition, however, shifted attention to the auditory channel. Ten percent of the factual information contained in news stories was lost to participants. It appears that this multimessage format exceeded viewers' attentional capacity.

Since such a wide variety of cues are available to the expressive individual, contradictory messages will be communicated by most individuals from time to time. The present study investigated the response of judges to incongruent cues.

Judges were presented a 46 item test in which they were to rate the affect communicated through an individual's concurrent facial expression and linguistic message. On 32 of these items the face and the words communicated markedly different levels of pleasantness. Groups of 42 and 35 undergraduate students were tested for their tendency to utilize one or the other kind of cue. Data analysis suggested strikingly high reliability in individual's responsivity to facial or linguistic cues (r =.87, .92).

Tests of this kind cannot be used to make statements about the general level of the public's responsivity to one kind of cue or another, since the artificial cues can be manipulated to make one or the other cue more or less striking, and the collector of any artificial cues has no way of knowing to what extent his material is representative of communication in the world at large.

These new players, which we term “Cybermediaries,” are organizations that perform the mediating tasks in the world of electronic commerce. We illustrate that the case for the elimination of intermediaries in the move to create direct producer-consumer links is based on questionable assumptions. We then examine functions of intermediaries that are not easily absorbed by producers. We describe some of the new forms of cybermediaries, noting the new needs that electronic commerce imposes on producers and consumers. We note that using a rational, economic logic rooted in transaction cost theory, it is equally plausible to conclude that more, rather than fewer intermediaries will be involved in electronic markets. Finally, we briefly highlight several social and institutional factors that also may mitigate against the elimination of intermediaries. This broader perspective of the role of intermediaries in the exchange process calls for incorporating consumer-centric and institutional perspectives into the discussion of the evolution of electronic market structures.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1995.tb00167.x,

This sensemaking, we contend, lends important critical insight into powerful cultural constructions of individual mothers as responsible for the creating, sustaining, and ultimately resolving the mommy wars.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ccc/tcy008,

In political theory, ideal theories are often criticized as being detached from actual, existing social conditions and real-world problems. Similarly, it can be argued that abstract and idealized models of freedom of communication and media do not provide the most useful theoretical resources for analyzing the factors that enable or constrain free expression in contemporary societies. The article discusses the implications of three different non-ideal approaches to freedom: Axel Honneth’s normative reconstruction, the capabilities approach developed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, and the notion of agonistic freedom associated with radical democratic theory.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qty013,

In the fourteen years the course has been offered, it has been successfully completed by about two thousand students, with an average failure of about three percent. This high percentage of completion is attributed to three things: the communication skills developed are related to the work of engineers; the teaching method is analytical; and the student's work is carefully evaluated by the instructor and revised by the student when not acceptable. The instructor is, of course, another prime factor; a few have been unable to teach the course effectively. In addition to other capabilities, the instructor of this course must be willing to accept the fact that he is teaching the course to make a better engineer-not a journalist, orator, or technical writer.

Dynamic models are used to systematically examine endogenous and exogenous influences on message processing to more accurately understand the effects of Msv-d variables and individuals' sensation seeking tendencies during the processing of the Psas.

Support was found for the prediction that the kind of critical response set induced and the target of the criticism are mediators of resistance to persuasion. The more critical acts are focused on arguments presented in a persuasive message, the more likely that the critical act will not be distracting and therefore promote counterarguing which will lead people to be resistant to subsequent persuasive messages arguing on the same side of given attitudinal issue. When criticism is less central to message variables and focuses on speaker and/or delivery characteristics, distraction occurs which decreases the probability of counterarguing and induces people to be vulnerable to forthcoming persuasive messages. This is especially true when negative criticism of speaker characteristics reduces threat to present attitudes and reduces motivation to counterargue to protect privately held beliefs. A completely counterbalanced design employing several manipulation checks was created to rule out competing explanations for differential resistance to persuasion.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1978.tb00620.x,

To test competing claims, different versions of an audio-visually presented chase sequence were produced. Experimental materials were varied in a factorial design featuring the five levels of perceived outcome-uncertainty (hero's chances of success/survival = 0/100, 1/100, 25/100, 50/100, 100/100) and three levels of disposition toward the protagonist (neutral, mildly positive, strongly positive).

I then turn to the consequences of particular methodological choices, drawing on key works in Science and Technology Studies (STS) to make the point that these methodological choices not only establish scientific fields, they construct certain types of human subjects as well. The article concludes with a call for a more humanistic and interpretive approach to the understanding of political behavior and communication.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtaa008,

A conference for Korean students in the following semester was added and analyzed for more diverse cross-cultural comparisons. In terms of the first part of this study, computer log data indicated that there were more cross-cultural postings in the Finnish conference by U.S. students than Finnish visitors within the U.S. conference. In addition, student postings made up nearly 80 percent of these discussions. Qualitative content analyses of computer transcripts were conducted to compare their collaborative behaviors with the conferences. Results revealed some cross-cultural differences in the participants' online collaborative behaviors. Korean students were more social and contextually driven online, Finnish students were more group-focused as well as reflective and, at times, theoretically driven, and U.S. students more action-oriented and pragmatic in seeking results or giving solutions. The U.S. and Finnish students spent much time sharing knowledge and resources and also providing cross-cultural feedback. Findings indicate that instructors who facilitate online collaboration among multicultural students need to be aware of cultural differences in the learners' online collaborative behaviors, and such differences need to be taken into account to foster online collaboration among culturally diverse learners.

I advance this argument by historicizing Guy Debord’s notion of the Spectacle via Autonomist Marxism and Voloshinov’s materialist semiotics. Shedding light on the tensions inhabiting the post-Fordist labor process its users are involved in—such as autonomy/heteronomy, sociability/alienation, and display/concealment—I show how Snapchat points to a Spectacle that consistently operates through a dialectic of socialization, which enables and compels, consorts and estranges, and deceives and exhibits.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ccc/tcz029,

This article argues for the existence of two, mutually exclusive worldviews of organization and communication, one heteronomous, the other autonomous. A beteronomous model views organization as responding to an environment, and communication as the exchange of information. An autonomous model assumes organization to be generative of its own structures, through a reflexive process of self-production. The resulting “cell” of talk, in the autonomous model, is a conversation. Conversations are reflexive and self-organizing: they are produced by communication but are in turn the frame, or envelope, of the communication that generated them, in the absence of which communication would be impossible. They are the Organization in the communication. The article explores, through the mechanism of speech acts, the reflexive properties of human conversation, and its capacities to generate those relational properties that we associate with organization. The phenomenon of coupling and its organizational implications are briefly explored.

Interruption frequency did not change over age or across dyads of different sex composition. Males did not interrupt any more than females did and females were interrupted by their partners as frequently as males were interrupted by theirs, with one exception: Grade 9females were interrupted more by their female partners. Interruptions were asymmetrically distributed in same-sex and opposite-sex dyads; however, the asymmetry in opposite-sex dyads was not predictablefrom sex of subject or sex of partner.

I argue that poststructural theory, and specifically a Foucauldian orientation toward discourse and power, can provide scholars of interpersonal communication a novel yet disciplinarily grounded avenue for future critical empirical research. By providing a roadmap that traverses the history of critical thought in interpersonal communication, redirects key vocabulary, offers avenues for integrating critical theory into empirical research, and emphasizes pathways of critical qualitative inquiry, I contend that the subdiscipline of interpersonal communication will be enriched through attention to power in the discursive constitution of identities and relationships.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/comt.12107,

Using hierarchical linear modeling, we examined individual- and crew-level influence on four assimilation outcomes: involvement, trustworthiness, commitment, and acceptance. At the individual level, acculturation predicted all the four assimilation outcomes. Involvement also was a predictor of the latter sequences of assimilation: commitment and acceptance. The study also found that one crew-level variable—crew performance—affected and modified the influence of tenure, proactivity, involvement, acculturation, and trust on members’ commitment. Implications are offered for the influence of group interaction on member assimilation and support for continuing group-level research on assimilation.

The DPI demonstrated high reliability, content, discriminant, and construct validity relative to earlier conflict instruments. An empirical study of social escalation was conducted among peers with different strengths of informal relations in an electronics firm. The study results revealed that interpersonal problems among weakly tied peers are likely to be contained at the grievance stage using covert behaviors or to be socially escalated to disputes involving third parties. More strongly tied peers are likely to escalate their problems from grievances to dyadic confrontations only.

This preoccupation with understanding problems is viewed as grounded in prematurely theorized idealizations and privileged perspectives that deepen skepticism concerning the extent to which interactants understand each other. Although this skepticism treats understanding problems as worthy of attention to the extent they produce dysfunctional effects on interactions, relationships, and institutions, work on doing understanding argues that a central problem for analysis is how interactants repair troubles of understanding in a way that minimizes their consequentiality for subsequent interaction. Proposals for explicitness, as in active listening techniques, and vigilance in employing existing interpretive and actional resources are critiqued as superfluous and violative of a moral-interactional order in which the presumed intelligibility of contributions to talk-in-interaction is enacted, renewed, and maintained.

In a 2 (Bodily Addressing) × 2 (Verbal Addressing) between-subjects experiment (N = 198) viewers reported a more intense parasocial experience if they were addressed by a TV performer on a bodily and verbal level. In addition, the more viewers perceived the performer to be attractive and the stronger their perspective-taking ability, the more intense their parasocial experience. Stronger parasocial experience resulted in higher commitment to social norms and a greater enjoyment of the exposure situation.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01595.x,

While the approach proposed by the Montreal School has advanced research in the subject to a remarkable degree, it does not take reflexivity of actors into account. On the one hand, this makes the identification of actors to a certain degree arbitrary and the concept of actors too wide. On the other hand, it underestimates actors as it neglects actors' capacity to propose their own ontology. In order to cope with these issues while maintaining the notion of nonhuman agency as proposed by Cooren et al., I would like to propose a de-ontologized notion of communication and agency based on the work of Gotthard Günther (e.g. 1976a, 1979a) and Niklas Luhmann.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/comt.12095,

The survey showed that SNS provide an opportunity to reach individuals less interested in politics. Viewing a candidate's profile further strengthened existing attitudes.

First, an individual can either seek to maximize his own self-benefit or to maximize the mutual group benefit, but he cannot do both simultaneously, as Bostrom indicates. Second, regarding the assumption that individuals consistently order their preferences according to an internal scale: the probability of consistency of preference, criterion valuation, and interval units of identical size is very small in real life situations. (An acceptable method of dealing with interval units, using ratios of differences, is described.) Third is the criticism that Bostrom focuses game theory on the solution of an interaction rather than on the communication process through which the solution is derived.

In his rejoinder, Bostrom denies stating that individuals will interact to achieve their greatest mutual satisfaction—but that they ought to, and his purpose was to make possible an analysis of the degree to which particular communicative acts approached this “ideal.” To restrict game theory to conflict situations (as Beisecker, and past game theorists, have done) is to ignore a potentially valuable tool for communication research.

For smartphone users, being online emerges as the default position and there is evidence that new media become constitutive of relationships in situations of extreme separation. However, technology cannot overcome difficulties that are fundamentally social. Moreover, the article observes the emergence of a new ‘care divide’ between those who own smartphones and those who do not.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jcc4.12069,

In this study 12 dyadic conversations are analyzed for interspeaker influence, with the use of time series regression procedures. Two versions of the data are presented: a probability summary including the probability of breaking mutual silences, continuing simultaneous talk, and continuing talking alone and a turn summary including vocalization, pause, and switching pause duration. Results show that (1) moment-to-moment influences are present in both versions of the data, (2) these influences differ from dyad to dyad, (3) the influences are both positive (matching) and negative (compensating), and (4) the magnitude of interspeaker influence on a temporal basis is small but detectable. In addition, there are overall tendencies to match in switching pause, probability of continued simultaneous speech, and probability of breaking mutual silences. Dyads show both compensation and matching on vocalization duration and pause-related variables.

Thus, previous co-viewing research has used various theories related to different aspects specific to each study, making it difficult to comprehend the connections between the studies. The aim of this paper is to propose a comprehensive model of the effects of co-viewing on the experience of watching a narrative text. Based on existing psychological theories that are applied to co-viewing contexts, the model includes the various processes underlying the effects of co-viewing, along with suggested moderators of these processes. While there is empirical evidence supporting some of the effects the model suggests, others have not yet been investigated.

The study used a combination of webmetric analyses and interviews with experts. From interviews we were able to explore how experts on these topics use search engines within their specialist fields. Using webmetric analysis, we were able to compare the results from a number of search engines and show how the top ranked sites are clustered as well as the distribution of their connectivity. Results suggest that the Web tends to reduce the significance of offline hierarchies in accessing information – thereby “democratizing” access to worldwide resources.

We argue that the decline of local newspapers has contributed to the nationalization of American politics: as local newspapers close, Americans rely more heavily on available national news or partisan heuristics to make political decisions. We assess the impact of newspaper closures on polarized voting, using genetic matching to compare counties that are statistically similar but for the loss of a local newspaper. We identify a small but significant causal decrease in split-ticket voting in presidential and senatorial elections in these matched communities: in areas where a newspaper closed, split-ticket voting decreased by 1.9%.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqy051,

This study tests the theory by examining how 52 Black women’s friendship groups communicate support about a racial microaggression committed by a white woman. The results demonstrate that strength regulation contributed to more derogative comments about aggressors during supportive discussions, and support seekers were less satisfied in their relationships with white women after the derogative conversations. Even though strength regulation and verbal derogation helped Black women psychologically address the aggressor, they did not consistently enhance women’s psychological ties to the friend group.

Three theories of humor creation emerge in humor research: the relief theory, which focuses on physiological release of tension; the incongruity theory, singling out violations of a rationally learned pattern; and the superiority theory, involving a sense of victory or triumph. Each theory helps to explain the creation of different aspects of humor, but each runs into problems explaining rhetorical applications of humor. Because each theory of humor origin tries to explain all instances of humor, the diverging communication effects of humor remain unexplained. Humor's enactment leads to 4 basic functions of humor in communication. Two tend to unite communicators: the identification and the clarification functions. The other 2 tend to divide 1 set of communicators from others: the enforcement and differentiation functions. Exploration of these effects-based functions of humor will clarify understanding of its use in messages. Humor use unites communicators through mutual identification and clarification of positions and values, while dividing them through enforcement of norms and differentiation of acceptable versus unacceptable behaviors or people. This paradox in the functions of humor in communication as, alternately, a unifier and divider, allows humor use to delineate social boundaries.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2000.tb00194.x,

It then explores the phenomenon of emergence of organization as an actor, capable of expressing an intention and participating in a dialogue involving other organizations. It explains this phenomenon of the emerging organizational self as a logical implication of the theory of self-organizing, which predicates ‘self-ness’ as an effect of the coupling of an autopoietic system to an observer.

Although the results of factor analyses (and related methods) of sets of ratings are often of immediate and intrinsic interest, there are few personality psychologists today who would claim that obtained factor structures represent inexorable verities (cf. Lykenn, 1971).

To explore these challenges empirically, we report on a series of descriptive case studies on global virtual teams whose members were separated by location and culture, were challenged by a common collaborative project, and for whom the only economically and practically viable communication medium was asynchronous and synchronous computer-mediated communication. The results suggest that global virtual teams may experience a form of ‘swift’ trust but such trust appears to be very fragile and temporal.

Many theoretical models and literature reviews conceptualize collaboration through a teleological lens where being ""good"" is tied to accomplishing the collaboration's goals. In this essay, we broaden the understanding of collaboration problematizing what is meant by a good outcome. We propose collaboration is a principled activity with associated processes and outcomes and advance three arguments. First, that collaboration when viewed as a principled activity changes our understanding of collaborative processes and the way we might evaluate collaborative outcomes. Second, that dialogue operates as ""ethical practice"" and is woven through communication in collaboration that facilitates principles such as legitimacy, accountability, and shared power. Third, a principled lens of collaboration further develops the principled negotiation process, problematizing so-called objective criteria for decision making. This essay begins by attending to certain principles associated with collaboration processes. We review the experience of communication in collaboration as being oriented toward dialogue, interests, conflict, consensus, and solutions. Building on the ways in which communication is oriented to in collaboration, we use an empirical example to posit the importance of conceptualizing and evaluating collaboration as principled. By directing attention to principles as an important component of collaboration, scholars are positioned to recognize useful responses and the implications of those responses for collaborating.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtz039,

Three forms of relational knowledge—general dimensional knowledge, situation-specific knowledge, and behavior-specific knowledge—were contrasted for their ability to account for biases in memory for relational implications of remarks in conversations. Two sets of results were noteworthy. First, very strong effects on both accuracy and direction of memory were found, indicating that some form of relational knowledge guided memory for conversations.

Les limites de l'action au sein des médias

Timothy A. Gibson

Cet article soutient que la théorie et la pratique de l'action au sein des médias souffre de limites pragmatiques et conceptuelles inhérentes. L'une des limites est d'ordre pratique : la dépendance des acteurs vis-à-vis des journalistes œuvrant dans les médias commerciaux restreint de façon radicale la capacité des militant d'atteindre les responsables et les citoyens à un rythme autre qu'épisodique. Une autre limite est d'ordre conceptuel. En soutenant implicitement une vision élitiste de la démocratie et en se concentrant sur le journalisme dominant, l'action au sein des médias omet de théoriser le rôle crucial que jouent les ressources et les stratégies médiatiques dans les mouvements locaux pour le changement social. L'article conclut avec une exploration de ce dont pourrait avoir l'air la théorie et la pratique de l'action au sein des médias si elles étaient informées par une théorie de la démocratie alternative, plus participative, et par un engagement envers la promotion d'une réforme médiatique.

Die Grenzen des Medienlobbyismus

Timothy A. Gibson

Medienlobbyismus wurde als ein Ansatz der Gesundheitskommunikationskampagnen von Public Health Wissenschaftler Lawrence Wallack entwickelt und sollte für den kritischen Medienwissenschaftler von großem Interesse sein. Medienlobbyismus bedient sich Agenda- Setting und Framing-Theorie, um Aktivisten für die Bevölkerungsgesundheit dabei zu unterstützen, Nachrichtenberichterstattung in kommerziellen Lokalmedien herzustellen und zu gestalten. Diese Berichterstattung wird dann wiederum genutzt, Druck auf Politiker auszuüben, wichtige soziale und gesundheitsbezogene Probleme zu beseitigen. Es gibt viel, was man bezüglich dieses politikzentrierten Ansatzes von Gesundheitskampagnen bewundern kann, insbesondere wenn man den individualisierten und freiwilligen Charakter der meisten anderen Ansätze der Gesundheitskommunikation dagegensetzt. Dennoch argumentiert dieser Artikel, dass die Theorie und Praxis von Medienlobbyismus an einigen ihr inhärenten pragmatischen und konzeptuellen Grenzen leidet. Eine Grenze ist praktischer Natur: Die Abhängigkeit der Medienlobbyisten von Journalisten der kommerziellen Medien beschneidet ihre Möglichkeiten, Politiker und Bürger anders als auf episodische Art und Weise zu erreichen. Eine andere Grenze ist konzeptuell: Indem implizit einer Elitetheorie von Demokratie angenommen wird und indem auf Mainstream-Journalisten und Medien fokussiert wird, versäumt es der Medienlobbyismus theoretisch zu bedenken, welche zentrale Rolle Medienressourcen und Strategien in lokalen Bewegungen gesellschaftlichen Wandels spielen. Diese Artikel schließt mit der Untersuchung, wie die Theorie und Praxis von Medienlobbyismus wohl aussehen würde, würde sie aus einer alternativen, mehr auf Teilhabe ausgerichteten Demokratietheorie und einem Engagement für die Förderung einer Medienreform gespeist werden.

Resumen

Este artículo sostiene que la teoría y práctica del apoyo de los medios sufre de algunos límites pragmáticos y conceptuales inherentes. Un límite práctico es: la dependencia en el apoyo de los medios de los periodistas trabajando en medios comerciales que constriñen radicalmente la habilidad de los defensores para alcanzar a los creadores de políticas y los ciudadanos en nada más que una forma episódica. Otro límite es conceptual. Al avalar implícitamente una teoría elitista de la democracia y focalizar en el periodismo de la corriente dominante, el apoyo de los medios falla en teorizar el rol crucial de los recursos de los medios y las estrategias que juegan dentro de los movimientos sociales de cambio local. Este artículo concluye con una exploración de cómo la teoría y la práctica del apoyo de los medios sería si estuvieran informadas por una teoría de la democracia alternativa, más participativa así como también un compromiso hacia la reforma de los medios.",13.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1753-9137.2009.01057.x,

Data were collected in two local theaters in a Northeastern city using field interviews, follow-up telephone interviews, and participant observation. Findings revealed that Black womxn audiences (from various age groups) embodied an intersectional resistance discourse of disrespectability ( Cooper, 2012, 2017, 2018) through their (non)verbal behaviors and an ecology of the senses (i.e., sight and sound) that were situated at the intersection of ratchetness, playfulness, and informality. In doing so, they created a “homeplace,” making an otherwise uncomfortable and highly regulated public space suitable for their collective spectatorship of the film. We argue that Black womxn’s embodiment of ratchetness is not necessarily a unidimensional endeavor, but rather an ever-evolving, multifaceted resource that enables Black womxn to reach political and pleasurable ends.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqab016,

Kasperson et al., 1988; N. Pidgeon, R. E. Kasperson, & P. Slovic, [Eds] 2003). The conduit metaphor structure objectifies source, receiver, and messages, which are talked of as “objects” or “substances” passed along a conduit to a receiver to be recovered. Metaphor analysis of 6 semistructured interviews with laypersons about terrorism and the media showed how the conduit metaphor structures a subjective process of reification, quantification, comparison, and judgment. This interpretation suggests that the demands of the conduit metaphor structure for the transferred message to be “invariant” and “pure” can influence relationships of trust and blame between media and public.

Using artificial data, I illustrate how these statistical approaches can be applied to longitudinal data and show how they behave across different data scenarios. Further, extensions, limitations, and the theoretical contribution of the framework to the field of media effects research are discussed.

And based on the intercorrelations of viewing various content types, it seems that some types of content are viewed more or less habitually. Finally, an indicator of selecting to view or not view a given content type—watching more or less of that type than predicted based on the individual's total viewing—is quite differently related to social reality beliefs than is viewing itself. This provides support for considering cultivation effects as actual effects rather than the product of third variables or of reverse causation.

A theoretical framework is developed where cultivation is seen as the result of a self-reinforcing interaction between persuasive and motivational effects of transportation: Repeated highly transportive experiences contribute to the overall cultivation effect by adjusting the viewers’ worldviews after each exposure. At the same time, viewers are motivated to return to programming of a given genre because transportation is an enjoyable experience. Our study uses transportability as an indicator of repeated transportive experiences and seeks to test its validity and usefulness for cultivation research. Results indicate that transportability predicts transportation within specific viewing experiences. Although no linear moderation effects of transportability are found, the data suggest a nonlinear moderation. Genre-consistent attitudes held prior to exposure facilitate transportation, but transportation was not consistently related to increases in genre-related judgments after a single exposure.

The post-race pivot belies the country’s ongoing racist legacy, and potentially lulls viewers toward acceptance of official antiracisms that serve hegemonic interests.

We then present evidence from nationally representative survey experiments to demonstrate how warnings to dismiss future politicization and corrections to ignore past claims can counteract politicization's effects. The results provide novel insights about science communication in a politicized era and offer a blueprint on which future work can build.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jcom.12171,

The correlational evidence is consistent with a mass media effect on fertility. However, the evidence about discrete program effects, which reveals short—lived increases in demand for clinic services, is less consistent. We speculate that, if the spread of mass media has effects on fertility, it reflects a complex social process rather than a medium effect or a discrete learning process: multiple channels, providing reinforcing messages, over time, producing interpersonal discussion and a slow change in values, and working at a level of social aggregation higher than the individual.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2001.tb00253.x,

In the past decade distributed video systems have proliferated as tools for instruction and communication. These systems promise increased personal interaction by approximating natural communication through visual contact and verbal exchange. However, research on the use of these tools has consistently pointed out the dissatisfaction of users and the limitations placed on meaningful, engaged communication (Debough, 1999; Simonson et al., 2000). The problem centers on fostering co-presence and engagement among those who use interactive, video-based systems for distance education or work-related activities. The purpose of this paper is to enrich the conversation regarding how to address these issues of communication and engagement. I argue that because most distance education or electronic meeting systems employ variations of two-way compressed or digital video, they are essentially filmic media, and as such users of these distributed visual environments can capitalize on insights from the rich theoretic base of film theory and cinematic technique to engage meaningful interaction and support responsive communication.

To obtain individual and sociostructural data, we conducted a survey study among German high school students (N = 4,282). Using multilevel modeling, we found that the attributes of the school class only contributed to the risk of being involved in cyberbullying to a small extent. Still, procyberbullying norms in class did enhance the risk of perpetration and victimization for students, even more so than their individual beliefs. Previous experiences with bullying and intensive, unrestricted use of the Internet were the strongest individual predictors of cyberbullying involvement.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/hcre.12056,

The 647 idioms reported were coded for their form (i.e., verbal versus nonverbal), context of use (i.e., private idioms, which were used only when others were not present, versus public idioms, which could be used in the presence of others), and function (i.e., confrontations, expressions of affection, labels for outsiders, nicknames, requests, sexual invitations, sexual references/euphemisms, and teasing insults). For both sexes, loving, commitment, and closeness were correlated with number of reported idioms that expressed affection, initiated sexual encounters, and referred to sexual matters. The only significant relationship for liking was between females' liking scores and the frequency of idioms with sexual referents. A log-linear analysis revealed a significant association between the function of the idioms and their form; labels for outsiders, nicknames, sexual references/euphemisms, and teasing insults were almost always verbal. A significant association was also found between idiom function and context of use; labels for outsiders and teasing insults were most often used in situations involving other people, whereas sexual invitations and sexual references/euphemisms were usually used in private situations.

More importantly, as suggested in Martin's (1986) set/reset model, this study extends priming effects beyond the simple hydraulic patterns of accessibility effects. It reveals that both attitudes toward military action and attitudes toward a diplomatic solution were used in subsequent judgments of the president's job performance and handling of the war. The associations between attitudes toward a diplomatic solution and subsequent judgments were even stronger than those between attitudes toward military action and the same subsequent judgments, despite the clear prowar primes of news discourse in the air-war context.

To address these problems, this essay integrates diverse philosophical and empirical works to define deliberation and place it in a broader theoretical context. Public deliberation is a combination of careful problem analysis and an egalitarian process in which participants have adequate speaking opportunities and engage in attentive listening or dialogue that bridges divergent ways of speaking and knowing. Placed in the meta-theoretical framework of structuration theory (Giddens, 1984), deliberation is theorized to exist at the center of a homeostatic loop, in which deliberative practice reinforces itself. A review of theory and research on the causes and effects of deliberation leads us to develop this structurational conceptualization into the self-reinforcing model of deliberation. This model posits that public deliberation is more likely to occur when discussion participants perceive potential common ground, believe deliberation is an appropriate mode of talk, possess requisite analytic and communication skills, and have sufficient motivation. Deliberation directly reinforces participants' deliberative habits and skills, and it indirectly promotes common ground and motivation by broadening participants' public identities and heightening their sense of political efficacy.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2002.tb00276.x,

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States today. Due to advances in new medical technology, screening devices for many cancers including breast, cervical, and colon cancers, are drastically reducing mortality rates. These technologies are able to detect cancer early, allowing for earlier treatment and a better survival rate. Unfortunately, many people, especially those in low socioeconomic groups, those without health insurance, and minority groups have very low cancer screening rates. As a result of not being screened, these populations face higher rates of cancer. One way to improve cancer screening rates in low income and minority populations is to target the healthcare staff which works with them. CancerSPACE (Simulated Practice and Collaborative Education) is aimed to improve cancer screening education among healthcare professionals in a virtual, interactive, easy to use online simulation presented in a game format. Simulated education, such as this, can be used on an individual basis at times and locations which are convenient for staff members.

Contrary to the common impression, the U.S. public is largely uninformed rather than misinformed of a wide range of factual claims verified by journalists. Importantly, we find that the success of belief updating after exposure to corrective information (via a fact-checking article) is dependent on the presence, the certainty, and the accuracy of one’s prior belief.

To the extent that there is inconsistency in cues across narrative levels, viewers, especially children, can become confused. We found more evidence of consistency than inconsistency across levels, but a high degree of that consistency reinforces the interpretation that violence is frequently unpunished and socially acceptable.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02820.x,

This community can be seen as a sub-section or a specific discursive space categorized under “affective publics” (Papacharissi, 2014).

This view of “communicative choice” is consistent with “purposive” explanations for human action, but advocates of A1 models are not satisfied with the models, such as the practical syllogism, employed by “action” theorists. Instead, A1 modelers base their accounts of activity on models that are technically equivalent to high-level computer programs.

Three types of AI-based models —plans, transition networks, and production systems —are reviewed, and the extent to which each can represent a set of “commonsense” notions about communication is analyzed.

It moves on by conceptualizing participatory confinement through the lens of the invitation to governmentality. In order to develop this, the article focuses on two modes of participatory confinement: unpaid labor that asylum seekers do as “voluntary” activities and knowledge and data extraction.

The fact that gamers are largely in control of the game implies that they can voluntarily select the emotional situations they confront. This freedom is attractive for adolescents who are in the midst of constructing an identity. For them, the violent game is a safe, private laboratory where they can experience different emotions, including those that are controversial in ordinary life.

In addition, attention to crime news was positively associated with harsher culpability ratings of a hypothetical race-unidentified suspect and a Black suspect but not a White suspect. Finally, heavier consumption of Blacks’ overrepresentation as criminals on local television news was positively related to the perception of Blacks as violent.

The analysis of the cases is based on ethnography of online newsrooms working routines and in-depth interviews with reporters, editors and web developers. The actual role of the myth of interactivity in shaping the development of these four online news projects is discussed taking into account the material and organizational context of the newsrooms.

Three phases were discovered and designated as interpersonal conflict, confrontation, and substantive conflict. During the interpersonal conflict phase, conflict is indirect and probably stems from individual differences.

That is, students learn a developmental sequence of increasingly complex and interacting structures of learned capabilities.

We then discuss how relationship intimacy, power dynamics, and information expectancies correspond with information-seeking behavior within close relationships. In doing so, we highlight how the negotiation of relational uncertainty may function to sustain intimate associations.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2002.tb00806.x,

Building on media multiplexity and attachment perspectives, we argue that communication over a dyad’s media ecosystem, including face-to-face, text messaging, cellphone calls, e-mail, and instant messaging, creates connected availability. Connected availability is the perception that a partner is at a continuous (digital) arm’s reach offering protection and security. Using longitudinal dyadic data of cohabitating romantic partners, we track the effects of media multiplexity on well-being by factoring in both partners’ perspectives to untangle the security offered through partner’s availability from the stress of maintaining one’s own constant availability to a partner. The results support salutary effects of media use on well-being because of increased connected availability, with limited evidence for adverse impacts of maintaining constant availability with a close partner.

The always-on, always-available nature of digital life means almost constant connection and availability between romantic partners, family members, and close friends. Being tethered to one another can give people a sense of security, while simultaneously causing more stress. In this article, we find that keeping a romantic partner constantly within a (digital) arm’s reach promotes better well-being for oneself. In addition, keeping a romantic partner always available also predicted better well-being for the romantic partner.

“Thirty years from now, the big university campuses will be relics. Universities won’ t survive … Do you realize that the cost of higher education has risen as fast as the cost of health care?… Such totally uncontrollable expenditures, without any visible improvement in either the content or the quality of education, means that the system is rapidly becoming untenable. Higher education is in deep crisis… Already we are beginning to deliver more lectures and classes off-campus via satellite or two-way video at a fraction of the cost. The college won't survive as a residential institution. …. Or Will They?

Technology-Mediated Learning and Distance Learning (TML/TMDL), and particularly asynchronous learning through the Internet, are becoming major vehicles for fulfilling the needs of Lifelong Learning (LLL). A hybrid model of studies using technological means is leading to the development of a new pedagogy of learning and teaching. Various new models of higher education are evolving in North America and around the globe, in response to LLL needs and to the new opportunities that are becoming available through the integration of learning technologies. These models are described and discussed in this paper, for the benefit of those who are interested in or are partners to higher education, and in particular the policy makers. Traditional universities can adopt some of these models, while other models may call for the creation of new types of institutions of higher education. Most institutions will find that a joint effort is necessary for reaching the critical mass required for providing their educational system and their faculty with a generalizable, scalable and sustainable TML solution. Creating such coalitions will turn out to be a challenge in and of itself.",4.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1998.tb00094.x,

I see the increasing attention to this issue as a consequence of two different, yet intertwined, acts of student activist labor: the confrontational labor of call out culture, especially as it manifests on social media platforms, and the caring labor of creating communities of support amongst survivors and allies.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ccc/tcy021,

A new method (the Iowa Communication Record) is offered to extend research using diary methods and focus the researcher on communication in daily life. Three studies collectively show (a) consistent sex differences in the quality and nature of conversations across different types of relationships, (b) a consistent rank ordering of relationship types that differs from that intuitively included in previous models of relationship formation, and (c) a consistent difference between conversations held on different days of the week, with Wednesdays associated with greater degrees of conflictive communication. Self-disclosure is much less frequent in everyday life than assumed on the basis of laboratory work, and the predominant form of communication in intimate relationships is not only nonintimate but not simply distinguishable from communication in other relationship types. Communication quality distinguishes female from male partners, suggesting that previous findings on preference for female partners are truly founded in communication variables, which have previously been underrated. The article shows that closer attention must in future be paid to communicative variations created by daily events and circumstances, and the role of routine communication in daily life must be explored in future studies of social participation.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1991.tb00545.x,
