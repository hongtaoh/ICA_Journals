This research seeks to investigate how cultural differences in communication styles may affect expertise recognition and influence in face-to-face (FtF) versus text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC). Using experimental intercultural groups, we found that in FtF groups East Asian experts had a lower participation rate, and were perceived as less competent, less confident, and less influential than experts from Western culture. No such differences occurred in CMC. The results support mediated moderation effect of perceived confidence on expert influence such that changes in perceptions of Chinese and American experts' confidence accounted for their different levels of influence in CMC versus FtF. No such effect was found with participation rate.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jcc4.12018,

The same lecture was presented to Group B (experimental), but at increased word speed (14 minutes duration). Group C (non-treatment) was not exposed to the tape recorded lecture. Rotational design was used for the second lecture presentation to adjust for possible inter-group differences. A thirty item recall test was administered to groups A and B immediately after presentation, and to the non-treatment group. Two to three weeks after each lecture a twenty item retention test was administered to groups A and B. Analysis of variance was computed on the raw test scores of control, experimental, and non-treatment groups for Recall Test I and II. A significant F-ratio (p <.001) was found for group comparisons on both tests. T-tests were calculated on the raw test scores of control and experimental groups for Recall Test I, Recall Test II, Retention Test I and Retention Test II.

We consider two different moments at length: a commercial interactive game from 1984 that made novel use of cassettes and sound, and the production and reception of early Twitter adaptations of Shakespeare in 2010. By standing in for the aesthetic possibilities and limits of a changing media space, Shakespearean references and deviations from them serve a key role for artists and critics in debates over the legitimacy and significance of creative work in emergent media.

Study 1 involved examination of the self-reports of 139 female and 85 male participants. Results of the analysis showed that participants high in global uncertainty define initial interaction in comparatively negative ways, more frequently attempt to avoid conversations with unfamiliar targets, perform less effectively when meeting others for the first time, and develop less satisfactory long-term relationships than persons low in global uncertainty. Global uncertainty also combined with participants’ sense of the self-assuredness-awkwardness of first encounters to predict initial interaction performance. Study 2 examined the conversational performance of 48 females and 28 males who had participated in the first investigation. This analysis revealed that, during the first minute of interaction, persons high in global uncertainty engaged in comparatively low levels of question asking but relatively high levels of disclosure. High globally uncertain participants were also rated less competent by their partners than were persons low in global uncertainty. Study 3 explored the relationship between global uncertainty, communication competence, and communication apprehension. Examination of the self-reports of 63 females and 49 males showed that persons high in global uncertainty are apprehensive when meeting strangers and enact acquaintanceship episodes relatively inexpertly, although the magnitude of correlations between the constructs provide strong evidence that global uncertainty is distinguishable from both competence and apprehension.

Tocqueville and the U.S. Supreme Court have both reasoned that jury service can promote civic engagement and recent research supports this view. The present study examines whether the attitudinal impact of jury deliberation depends on the quality of one’s jury experience. Two panel surveys of 2,410 total jurors tested the reciprocal relationship between the subjective experience of deliberation and the changes in civic attitudes toward oneself, fellow citizens, and public institutions. Principal results of structural equation models showed multiple effects of jury deliberation on attitudes, but there were no effects on one’s civic identity and political self-efficacy. Reciprocally, every civic attitude except faith in fellow citizens was predictive of deliberative experience in at least one of the two studies.

We are deliberately playful with the term professionalism in demonstrating the power of its ambiguity for reflecting, shaping, and indexing particular kinds of social relations and expectations for them. Part of our argument concerns the complex interplay of symbolism and materiality in the domains of interaction and artifacts surrounding “the professional,” and especially its embodiment in work and other settings. This brings us directly to an examination of the “intersectionality” of aspects of difference in the world of the professional (and by implication, the nonprofessional), including race, gender, and class, and to observe a broad-based cultural dialectic of the civilized and the primitive.

To empirically determine the influence of organizational features, perceived benefits, and social pressures on organizations' innovation adoption decisions, this study examined the decisions of 288 organizations to adopt Internet websites. Organizational social pressures were found to be the most significant discriminators of adopters and non adopters, although they were not particularly important in predicting the likelihood of future adoption for those organizations currently without websites. This finding suggests that social pressures are significant in innovation adoption, but that they may have their strongest effect during the early phases of innovation diffusion.

Ample evidence shows that people benefit tremendously from participating in online health support communities, but less is understood about how people who do not actively participate in interactions benefit from these communities. We conducted an online experiment using a sample of young adults in the United States. The results showed that females, compared with males, are more likely to be persuaded to seek professional counseling for mental health issues from observing a supportive conversation online.

We argue that the transition pattern of an individual’s social grooming style based on five social grooming behaviors at different times—referred to as the social grooming transition pattern—is the key to exploring this issue. Based on the social grooming style framework, we employed latent transition analysis through a nationally representative, three-year panel survey (N = 710) in Taiwan. We found that active users remained active in social grooming behavior and had options to shift, and inactive users largely remained inactive in terms of Facebook social grooming style. The results indicated that persistent social image managers gained the most social capital and well-being, greater than persistent social butterflies and those who transitioned from image managers to social butterflies, indicating that adopting strategic social grooming styles in the long-term delivered the best social outcomes.

Lay Summary

The long-term interaction between Facebook use and well-being has received limited attention with mixed results. One way to examine this is to study changes in the way that we “groom” one another in Facebook. That is, how we socially interact with others by discussing different topics with various styles and strategies. Based on the social grooming framework, we provide the first study employing latent transition analysis (i.e., to track how people change or maintain their social grooming style across time) to examine this issue using a nationally representative, three-year panel survey from Taiwan. Our study shows that most people maintain a stable user style over time. However, some become less active (e.g., they become “maintainers” or “lurkers”). Thus, the majority of Taiwanese users often do not create their own postings, but rather comment on, or simply view, the content of other Facebook users. By contrast, users who actively groom (e.g., those who are persistent “social butterflies” or “image managers”) continue to create online posts. Our analysis shows that users who are highly social benefit from greater bridging social capital. However, the strategically active social groomer is the winner as they benefit by gaining greater bridging social capital, social connectedness, and social life satisfaction.",3.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmab011,

Using both field and experimental data, this paper show that consistent reviews are perceived as more helpful than inconsistent reviews, independent of them being positive or negative. Experiments show that this valence consistency effect is driven by causal attributions, such that consistent reviews are more likely to be attributed to the actual product experience, while inconsistent reviews are more likely to be attributed to some reviewer idiosyncrasy. Supporting the attribution theory framework, reviewer expertise moderates the effect of consumers' causal attributions on review helpfulness.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jcc4.12106,

It was also hypothesized that the need for protection would negatively influence whether people felt that they had the communication efficacy to reveal their secret to these family members, which would also foster continued concealment. The results from Study One suggested that protection mediated the connection between family members' aggression and individuals' concealment of secrets from them. In addition, regardless of whether people believed they could communicate the secret to aggressive family members or not, they were likely to continue to conceal the secret if they were afraid that it would either hurt themselves or others.

However, little research has empirically tested this assumption. In line with social network theory, we proposed, instead, that online social communication would complement or supplement the uses of face-to-face social contact resulting in a positive association between the two forms of social behaviors. We assessed the frequency and intimacy of traditional social behaviors, sociability, and shyness in 115 undergraduates (52 male, 63 female). These variables were then used to predict the frequency and intimacy of Internet social communication. Sociability and the frequency of traditional social behaviors were positively associated with the frequency of Internet social communication. The intimacy of traditional social behaviors was positively associated with the intimacy of Internet social communication. Overall, the findings supported the implications of social network theory in that online social communication appeared to complement or be an extension of traditional social behavior rather than being a compensatory medium for shy and socially anxious individuals.

For the past 3 decades, journalists have framed Rogers as a calming influence and treated him with deference and respect. Journalists have created a fantasy about Rogers that holds him up as the embodiment of television's potential, potential that can be realized only by returning to the quiet tolerance and the power of imagination at the heart of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. For reporters in this interpretive community, Rogers offers hope for those struggling to raise children. A rhetorical vision of Rogers as “the world's nicest grown-up,” the “Dalai Lama of television,” and “the Pied Piper of children's television” is constructed out of the fantasy themes by journalists stepping outside their usual role as objective observers. Journalists who start off skeptical of Rogers and his approach find themselves captivated by his message, and they insert this experience into their coverage of Rogers, making it a key fantasy theme.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb03002.x,

The theoretical literature, inspired mainly by the literary metaphor, typically takes interpretive density as the chief dimension underlying symbolic expression. Density measures have also dominated the analysis of semantic networks. There is now a sizeable amount of work on the generation of such networks from linguistic data. The majority of that work locates the network and displays it. When attempts are made to analyze the network, the focus is typically on the density (i.e., the number of links) of particular concepts (which serve as the nodes) within the network and on the inferences that can be made about the communicative prominence of such concepts in light of their density. While density is a useful way of analyzing the communicative “connectivity” of a symbol in a message, it provides only one dimension for analyzing connectivity within a semantic network. In this article we offer two further dimensions — conductivity and consensus — with which to analyze semantic networks for connectivity. We illustrate a typology based on these three dimensions. These dimensions and the associated typology form a useful conceptual device that enables the researcher both to specify and differentiate semantic objects within a rich typology for a given domain of analysis. We show this device at work by applying the dimensions and typology to different communication contexts and by discussing other possible domains where they can be applied.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1993.tb00070.x,

Intercultural coorientation is made problematic by the absence of certain shared communication system knowledge, which in same-culture interactions is used in the dynamic sociolinguistic negotiation of relational rights and obligations. We propose that the process of sociolinguistic negotiation of meanings relies fundamentally on probabilistic inference and have constructed a model based on Bayes' theorem. The model predicts the effects of the communication situation, communicator stereotypes and prejudice, and some other-culture speaker errors on conclusions the receiver draws about the message. Using the model, we distinguish between the ethnocentric error of interpreting a communication in terms of one's own culture and the error of not seeing the communication as diagnostic. Among our predictions are: (a) the less diagnostic the communication, the more impact cultural stereotypes will have on attributions; (b) although evidence of sociolinguistic incompetence sometimes causes misunderstanding, it sometimes prevents misunderstanding; (c) multiple consistent features make intentions clearer than would a single cue, but multiple features violating co-occurrence norms often lead to the attribution of incompetence.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00785.x,

Data were gathered from self-report questionnaires and network analysis communication logs completed by organizational members (N = 79) of a geographically dispersed government health information agency, the Cancer Information Service (CIS). Tests of the models demonstrate that the coexisting model is clearly superior. These results suggest that the dual role of formal and informal structures needs to be more systematically specified as we focus on innovation in new organizational forms, such as the CIS.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00417.x,

We conducted a three-week experience sampling study among 353 adolescents (13–15 years, 126 assessments per adolescent). Using an advanced N = 1 method of analysis, we found sizeable heterogeneity in the associations of browsing with envy, inspiration, and enjoyment (e.g., for envy ranging from β = −.44 to β = +.71). The Passive Social Media Use Hypothesis was confirmed for 20% of adolescents and rejected for 80%. More adolescents with browsing-induced envy experienced negative effects on affective well-being (25%) than adolescents with no browsing-induced envy (13%).

Researchers have recently begun to apply the advertisement-based framework to a new context: user-generated social media photos. Despite findings that gender display appears prevalent in such images, deeper critical examinations of how the framework changes when applied across media contexts have not been meaningfully undertaken. Drawing from the interplay of Goffman’s concepts of hyper-ritualization and commercial realism, I argue that the manifestations and interpretive implications of gender display are contingent upon the standard of realism at play, proposing a standard of networked realism that differently modulates gender display in user-generated photography.

In this article, we critically examine coverage of each attack in The New York Times and The Washington Post, describing how the coverage employs therapeutic discourse frames that position the president as vulnerable and portray the attackers as lonely and demented outsiders. Noticing contradictions in this pattern, we also identify counterframes, including those acknowledging the political motivations of the assassins, the diminished public sphere that is a context for those actions, and the contradictions in a legal system that denies the insanity pleas of those framed so extensively as mentally ill. Political science, psychology, and law enforcement researchers have recognized that assassination attempts are often driven by rational political and economic concerns. Our analysis thus points to the need for further research exploring therapeutic framing techniques of other instances of political violence that may discourage publics from thinking critically about protest, violence, and tragedy in the United States.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1753-9137.2008.01030.x,

Results suggest that ego depletion may increase the risk of negatively appraising the use of interactive (video games) and noninteractive (television) entertaining media as a form of procrastination. The resulting guilt is negatively related to the recovery experience associated with using entertainment. Therefore, ego-depleted individuals may benefit less from the psychological recovery potential of entertainment media, despite their greater need for recovery.

The idioms described functioned to name activities, emotional states, objects, and places; communicate affection; manage confrontations; accomplish greetings and goodbyes; reference the self, partner, or other individuals; issue requests and insults; and denote sexual matters. In the main study, 114 females and 117 males each identified a close same-sex friend, completed the Interpersonal Solidarity Scale, and filled out an idiom report form for each idiom that had emerged in the friendship. The majority of the 1,380 idioms reported were verbal, used in public contexts, and used in more than just the one friendship described. For both sexes, solidarity was positively correlated with five idiom categories: activities, affection, confrontation, nicknames for self, and objects. In addition, solidarity correlated positively with place, requests, nicknames for friend, and sexual references for females and with emotions, greetings/goodbyes, labels for others, and teasing insults for males. For both sexes, solidarity was related to the total number and breadth (diversity) of idioms reported, as well as to other features of friends’ idiomatic codes.

Some studies observe only weak relationships, whereas others report significant relationships between these variables. H. J. Eysetick has maintained that the degree of relationship between traits and heart rate depends on the stress levels under which the respondents perform when heart rate data are collected. An inspection of the existing studies shows that, consistent with Eysenck's observation, the studies reporting relationships between public speaking trait anxiety and heart rate were conducted under relatively low-intensity conditions in comparison to those reporting no such relationships. In the present study, heart rates of both anxious and nonanxious speakers were measured under both high- and low-intensity conditions. Results indicated that (a) heart rates of anxious speakers were significantly higher than those of nonanxious speakers when both performed under low-intensity conditions, but (b) heart rates were not different for anxious and nonanxious speakers when performing in high-intensity environments.

This study sought to explore the nature of attributions that are used tactically in conversation. Among other tasks, participants were asked to describe conversations in which causal statements had been posited for some “ulterior” purpose—perhaps to evoke an emotion, obtain a behavior, or receive some sort of compliment. Results revealed that the most commonly cited tactical attributions included excuses, justifications, and affiliation moves. Nontactical attributions, in contrast, rarely included affiliation moves. Attributions that were used tactically also tended to focus more frequently on positive events, behaviors, or qualities and tended to emphasize interpersonal, stable sources more often than nontactical attributions. The most frequently perceived goal for tactical attributions was to obtain an object or behavior.

Respondents assessed the items while imagining themselves in one of eight hypothetical scenarios created to manipulate the three situational factors posited as significant by Brown and Levinson: relationship distance, relationship power, and the magnitude of the request. A factor analysis reduced the 32 tactics to four underlying factors, which in turn served as one variable set for a canonical correlation whose second variable set was the situational factors and the agent's gender.

Exploratory data suggest the component parts of negativity: misleading claims, emotional appeals, one-sided attacks, and a generally loathsome view of politicians. To better understand academic interest in the subject, it is necessary to explore the shared assumptions of the political reform movement of the past century and of reform-minded researchers—specifically their disdain for the emotional underpinnings of political behavior, even as emotion is linked with higher citizen engagement with politics. It is possible to pursue a better informed and less benighted discourse on campaign advertising by eschewing the global conception of negativity by more seriously engaging the theoretical bases of representative government.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2001.tb02906.x,

Investigations by three of the country's largest dailies, rather than advancing the Mercury's claims, turned into a sustained and damaging critique. Commentators have characterized this sharp scrutiny of a respected regional paper as everything from a defense of journalistic standards to damage control for the CIA. Nearly all, however, have ignored the larger critique of the Internet as a medium of news distribution that emerged in the follow-up coverage. This study examines the controversy as a case of news repair, ad defined by Bennett, Gressett, and Haltom (1985), noting what the case reveals about the operation of news repair itself in an era of Internet-based news delivery. The repair of “Dark Alliance” affirmed a paradigmatic understanding of what is and is not news. More broadly, it defended the authority of established broadsheets over the news media and affirmed the traditional hierarchy of national over regional newspapers. This paper argues that the Internet's role in the publication of this controversial exposé created both need and opportunity for repair of institutional boundaries—those violated by the Mercury's use of the new medium and a more general erosion in the ongoing migration of news to the Internet.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2001.tb02877.x,

EV theory predicts that given a communicator with high reward valence, high and very high involvement (including touch and close proximity) should be met with reciprocation (increased involvement), and low and very low involvement should be met with compensation (increased involvement). DA theory predicts compensating very high involvement with decreased involvement, reciprocating high involvement with increased involvement, compensating low involvement with increased involvement, and reciprocating very low involvement, with decreased involvement. Results supported neither theory as all involvement changes were met with reciprocity. Additionally, although all violations/discrepancies were followed by changes in arousal, size of arousal change was not monotonically related to size of involvement change, as predicted by DA theory. Finally, although positive versus negative emotional experiences were not related to physiological indicators of arousal change, size of involvement change was directly related to the experience of positive and negative emotions.

Leo Lowenthal, in his well-known analysis of popular magazine biographies, identified a marked shift in mass-mediated exemplars of success: from self-made industrialists and politicians (idols of production) to screen stars and athletes (idols of consumption). Adapting his approach, we draw upon a qualitative analysis of magazine biographies (People and Time, n = 127) and social media bios (Instagram and Twitter, n = 200), supplemented by an inventory of television talk show guests (n = 462). Today's idols, we show, blend Lowenthal's predecessor types: they hail from the sphere of consumption, but get described –and describe themselves –in production terms.

Its adoption started among teens but has since been taken into use by other age groups. However, the use patterns for teens seem to be different from those of older users. This paper examines the assertion that SMS is a life phase and not a cohort phenomenon. That is, its use is more intense among teens and more moderate among older age groups. Data for the analysis comes from a series of six nation-wide surveys of Norwegians over the age of 13. Questions on the reported use of SMS were included in all these surveys. This information was adjusted in order to remove the effects of generally increased use over time. The analysis shows that the proportion of text messages sent by different age groups stays rather stable over time. Indeed there seems to be a type of “standing wave” of use associated with older teens and those in their early 20s. While there are cohort effects visible in the data, the analysis indicates that texting is largely a life phase phenomenon. If the curve had flattened out with time it would have indicated that the teens are carrying texting with them as they grow older. This, it seems is not the case. The overall use of SMS has increased in Norwegian society but the relative distribution of the text messages has remained centered around those in their late teens.

College students and adolescents routinely provide personal information on profiles that can be viewed by large numbers of unknown people and potentially used in harmful ways. SNSs like Facebook and MySpace allow users to control the privacy level of their profile, thus limiting access to this information. In this paper, we take the preference for privacy itself as our unit of analysis, and analyze the factors that are predictive of a student having a private versus public profile. Drawing upon a new social network dataset based on Facebook, we argue that privacy behavior is an upshot of both social influences and personal incentives. Students are more likely to have a private profile if their friends and roommates have them; women are more likely to have private profiles than are men; and having a private profile is associated with a higher level of online activity. Finally, students who have private versus public profiles are characterized by a unique set of cultural preferences—of which the “taste for privacy” may be only a small but integral part.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.01432.x,

When asked to verbalize the reasons underlying their judgments, novices assigned lower ratings to abstract but not figurative works. Experts, in contrast, were not influenced by the verbalization manipulation.

Given that automated algorithms may define putative relationships between videos based on mutual topics, CM can appear directly linked to extremist content. This poses severe challenges for prevention programs using CM. This study investigates the extent to which algorithms influence the interrelatedness of counter- and extremist messages. By means of two exemplary information network analyses based on YouTube videos of two CM campaigns, we demonstrate that CM are closely—or even directly—connected to extremist content.

Ellul argued that the modern state is the product of the invasion of technique throughout society. Such an environment demands a form of communication Ellul described as propaganda.

But application of demand theory to the PRC reveals that whereas the functional equivalence assumption can be phrased in economic terms, there is no such validation for the constancy assumption. That assumption was found to be inconsistent with the Engel law/curve in that this traditional microeconomic model of consumer choice does not posit, as does the PRC, a proportional relationship between expenditures on mass media and income. Furthermore, the empirical literature reviewed here suggests mixed support for the PRC, casting more doubts on the validity of the PRC as a theoretically grounded, empirically determined hypothesis.

An ecology of games is a larger system of action composed of two or more separate but interdependent games. Defined in this way, the idea of an ecology of games is a sensitizing concept, developed within a participant-observer, case-study mode of inquiry. It helps make sense of the dynamics of communication policy processes. Aspects of an ecology of games—games, rules, strategies, and players—offer a grammar for describing the system of action shaping public policy.

Earlier research found that when the context of the lying involved the concealment of emotional responses, observers were more accurate when they observed persons’ bodies only than when they observed their heads. The present experiment extends this research by: (1) examining observer accuracy in a situation in which persons made true or false statements about a factual event, in addition to replicating the situation in which they concealed their emotional responses; and (2) presenting observers with additional categories of information, both in isolation and in combinations, and comparing resulting accuracy differences. Both types of dishonest behavior were viewed by 719 observers in one of 14 experimental conditions. They saw either color or black-and-white videotapes, which showed either a close-up of the person's face, a shot of the body only, or a shot of the head and body. Half of the observers viewed the stimuli without audio and half were allowed to hear the audio. These variables created a 3 (shot) by 2 (color/black-and-white) by 2 (visual only/audio and visual) factorial design. Audio-only and transcript conditions make up the final two cells.

This article summarizes a series of four studies which examined how people, in conversations, go about generating one emotion—that of guilt—in others. In the first study, a typology of 12 guilt moves was inductively devised. The most common ways of making another feel guilty were: reminding the other of his or her obligation to a relationship, listing sacrifices one has made for the other, reminding the other of his or her role responsibilities, comparing the other to someone else, and questioning the other. The primary reason for using guilt in conversations was persuasion. In the second study, the typology's generalizability was confirmed. Findings also revealed that the likelihood of using guilt in conversations increases with greater relationship intimacy and that people believe others are more likely to use guilt than themselves. The 12 techniques for guilt elicitation were examined in the third study for their independence and dimensionality via multidimensional scaling. The results suggest three underlying dimensions (self-nonself, acquiescence-restrictiveness, and commission-omission) and six potential clusters. The final study conceptualized guilt elicitation and sensitivity as individual differences. A brief, multifactor scale of individuals’ tendency to use guilt, to use it with ease, and to be susceptible to guilt moves was developed.

The covering law and system paradigms are compared and five criteria are established for distinguishing the two explanatory genres. Three major advantages in using the system paradigm are discussed. These include a shift in the particular sets of variables which are selected for study, an increase in the complexity of analysis which may be employed, and the ability to integrate current research into a wider perspective.

There does seem to be some union support for future efforts in intra-union communication research- particularly from the State Central Body Presidents. Research is suggested primarily in the areas of how to communicate the importance of communication; communication patterns between various union dyads; characteristics of successful and unsuccessful communicators; and labor communication in conflict situations. The survey of oral communication shows the current status and disparity between training needed and training offered.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1968.tb00067.x,

As such, we take a sociocognitive approach to integrate perspectives on implicit societal expectations (connection norms) and automatic individual behavior (connection habits). Based on this framework, we present a model for how nonconscious “triggers” to check a mobile device, or connection cues, affect the flow of communication. The model outlines types of connection cues, factors that moderate sensitivity to connection norms, and activation paths for connection habits.

Strategies and their operationalizations from 74 compliance gaining message classifcation systems were previously integrated into a 64–category scheme that lists each strategy along with all definitions and examples located in the literature representing that strategy (Kellermann & Cole, 1991). Difficulties encountered during this cross-taxonomy strategy integration motivated an assessment, reported here, of the nature and structure of these different classification systems. The findings of this assessment of compliance gaining strategy taxonomies are threefold. First, current classification systems for compliance gaining messages include strategies that vary in myriad atheoretical ways, producing lists of techniques that are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. Research findings reflect the structure of chaotic classifcation systems rather than the essence of compliance gaining message behavior. Second, conceptual definitions of the strategies are unclear, nonspecific, nonexclusive, and nondelimiting; these definitions make understanding the nature of the strategies difficult and classfication unreliable. Third, approximately two-thirds of the operationalizations used in the research literature are not valid representatives of the strategies for which they were initially generated. As a result, many “accepted” knowledge claims about compliance gaining message behavior are suspect, misstated, and/or of unknown validity.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1994.tb00081.x,

Patients' verbal communication behaviors related to disclosure of information about the subjective component of their illnesses were coded across the same segments.

Average ad-level brain activation in these regions moderates the relationship between national TRPs and large-scale recall (p < .001), such that the positive exposure-recall relationship is more strongly observed for ads that elicit high levels of social processing and memory encoding in the brain.

All three hypotheses received at least partial support. Preinteractional expectancies, especially personal attribute ones, caused perceivers to evaluate targets and their communication behavior differently, with negatively valenced expectancies serving as negative violations. Relative to a pleasant, involved communication style, unpleasant, uninvolved communication was less expected and evaluated negatively, thus functioning as a negative violation; it also reduced credibility, attraction, and perceived rewardingness of the target.

A guitar tab is essentially sheet music for guitarists. The study examines why people contribute when it is easier for them not to publish their tabs and simply use the tabs that other people have posted. Answers to this will have implications for businesses wanting to encourage their employees to share their knowledge. An open ended questionnaire was sent to 183 tab publishers with a usable response rate of 39%, which is considered high for surveys. The questionnaire sought to gather data on motivations, benefits and community interaction. The paper begins with a review of relevant theories of knowledge sharing and publishing, in particular the private-collective model of innovation (von Hippel & von Krogh, 2003) which is used to analyze the results. Motivations are listed as under two categories, self and altruistic, with the most popular motivation being to share the songs with others, which is from the altruistic category. The most common benefit is personal satisfaction. The results show tab publishing fits with the private-collective model of innovation which means that a tab published online can be seen as a public good, as it is available to all, that has significant private elements. These private elements are the benefits that tab publishers get which the people who only use tabs without contributing their own, do not. The implications of the work are as follows. Enjoyment of the domain seems to be an important factor in motivating knowledge sharing. People who feel like they are part of a community and get satisfaction from being part of a community, will be more likely to contribute. The act of sharing knowledge should be as close to effortless as possible to encourage contributions. The act of preparing (collecting, collating etc.) the material to be shared should have meaning in itself for the person who is preparing it. If the act of sharing leads to increased status in the community people will be more likely to contribute. To encourage knowledge sharing, those who make use of the shared knowledge should be encouraged to give positive feedback to the person who shared it.

Researchers in the area of sex differences in human communication emphasize that variability may be related to sex roles. With regard to nonverbal sensitivity, researchers have suggested that femininity may be associated with better nonverbal decoding because of practice gained in traditionally feminine occupations. It has also been reasoned that certain traits, such as submissiveness and expressiveness, are linked to both femininity and nonverbal sensitivity. The present study investigates the relationship of sex, sex role, and nonverbal sensitivity. Whereas female sex was found to be positively associated with nonverbal ability, femininity was negatively related. Several interpretations of this surprising result are offered.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1980.tb00152.x,

However, recent experience with the slow adoption of other new media in Hong Kong, including cable TV and interactive TV, has sounded a cautionary note about the potential use and impact of the Internet in this technologically sophisticated city. Based on a telephone survey of 1,000 adult residents, this paper examines the adoption, use, and social impact of the Internet in Hong Kong using a chain process model that was initially developed by Dutton, Rogers, and Jun (1987) for research on home computing. The results show that Internet adoption is affected by a full range of factors, including one's personal characteristics, socioeconomic status, socio-cultural settings, and perceived compatibility of the Internet. On the other hand, Internet use is primarily affected by socioeconomic status and perceived compatibility. The study also found that both adoption and use of the Internet have observable impact on leisure activities and concerns for privacy and other Internet-related negative consequences.

In particular, effects of education, gender, sensation seeking, and prior firsthand or secondhand experience with alcohol-related mishaps on judgments of concern and/or severity were partially mediated by media variables. The authors concluded that media effects on risk judgments can be usefully understood as part of a larger social process in which media are selectively attended to due to exogenous influences; part of the effect of these exogenous influences on these social risk judgments was via these media influences.

La communication mobile et la vie civique : associer les usages à l’engagement civique et politique

Scott W. Campbell & Nojin Kwak

Cette étude a utilisé une approche des usages et gratifications pour investiguer les manières dont les usages de téléphones mobiles sont liés à l’implication civique et politique. Les résultats révèlent que l’usage de la technologie pour l’échange d’informations et la récréation sont des variables explicatives positives de la participation dans la vie civique. Les associations sont toutefois modérées par la compétence en communication mobile. Notamment, les individus qui déclarent de plus haut degrés d’aise avec la téléphonie mobile et qui l’utilisent pour l’échange d’informations tendent àêtre plus engagés civiquement et politiquement que ceux qui déclarent être moins à l’aise avec la technologie. Ces résultats jettent un nouvel éclairage sur le rôle positif de la communication mobile dans la société civile, tout en soulignant que la compétence est une dimension émergente du soi-disant fossé numérique « de second ordre », qui s’est traditionnellement concentré sur les compétences à l’ordinateur.

Mobilkommunikation und bürgerliches Leben: Die Verknüpfung von Nutzungsmustern mit bürgerlichen und politischen Engagement

Scott W. Campbell & Nojin Kwak

Die Studie nutzt einen Uses-and-Gratifications-Ansatz, um zu untersuchen, wie Handynutzungsmuster mit bürgerlicher und politischer Teilhabe verknüpft sind. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Nutzung der Technologie für den Informationsaustausch und Erholung positive Prädiktoren für eine Teilhabe am bürgerlichen Leben sind, wobei die Zusammenhänge durch Handykompetenz moderiert werden. Erwähnenswert ist, dass Teilnehmer, die eine größere Behaglichkeit im Umgang mit Mobiltelefonie angaben und diese für den Informationsaustausch einsetzen, häufiger bürgerlich und politisch involviert waren als jene, die sich unwohler mit der Technologie fühlten. Diese Ergebnisse beleuchten die positive Rolle der Mobilkommunikation in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft und unterstreichen dabei Kompetenz als die herausragende Dimension der sogenannten digitalen Kluft der zweiten Ebene, welche sonst immer auf Computerfähigkeiten fokussiert hat.

Disaster warning is viewed in the paper as a process consisting of a number of interrelated activities and procedures in which a variety of organizations and individuals become involved.

The study indicates that local officials such as those in Crescent City and Hilo are responsible for evaluating incoming information concerning potentially disruptive environmental changes and for determining if a public warning is to be issued. Among the problems that local officials may face while attempting to meet such responsibilities is the lack of adequate information on which to base critical decisions and the difficulty of maintaining public willingness to comply with requests for evacuation when there have been repeated alerts not followed by disaster.

Although both the communities in the study have undergone major tsunami disasters, the data show that this has been followed by significant change and improvement in warning procedures chiefly in Hilo. For example, evacuation areas have been predetermined in Hilo and a variety of mechanisms for transmitting tsunami warning signals and information to the public have been devised. These changes came about largely because local officials in Hilo received considerable feedback from scientific experts and others regarding the kinds of improvements needed in the community's warning system. Such a feedback process did not develop in Crescent City following the major tsunami disaster in that community and thus less change occurred in it5 warning procedures.",3.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1969.tb00834.x,

For women, media use predicted disordered-eating symptomatology, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and ineffectiveness. For men, media use predicted endorsement of personal thinness and dieting and select attitudes in favor of thinness and dieting for women. Magazine reading was a more consistent predictor than television viewing. Several relationships remained significant when interest in fitness and dieting as media topics was partialled out of the analyses.

Additional research is needed, however, to better understand the causes and consequences of partisan selective exposure. This study investigates the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization using data from the National Annenberg Election Survey. Cross-sectional results show strong evidence that partisan selective exposure is related to polarization. Over-time analyses document that partisan selective exposure leads to polarization.

La polarisation et l’exposition sélective partisane

Natalie Jomini Stroud

De nos jours, les gens peuvent aisément sélectionner les médias qui partagent leurs prédispositions politiques, un comportement connu sous le nom de l’exposition sélective partisane. Des études additionnelles sont toutefois nécessaires pour mieux comprendre les causes et les conséquences de l’exposition sélective partisane. Cette étude explore la relation entre l’exposition sélective partisane et la polarisation politique à partir de données du National Annenberg Election Survey. Les résultats en coupe transversale offrent des preuves solides à l’effet que l’exposition sélective partisane est liée à la polarisation. Des analyses au fil du temps documentent le fait que l’exposition sélective partisane mène à la polarisation. Certaines preuves soutiennent la direction causale inverse, à savoir que la polarisation mène à l’exposition sélective partisane. Les implications pour l’étude des effets médiatiques et les conséquences normatives (tant positives que négatives) sont discutées.

Polarisierung und voreingenommene selektive Wahrnehmung

Natalie Jomini Stroud

Heutzutage können Menschen ohne Probleme Medienangebote auswählen, die ihre politischen Prädispositionen widerspiegeln - ein Verhalten, welches als voreingenommene selektive Wahrnehmung bezeichnet wird. Wir benötigen allerdings intensivere Forschung, um die Gründe und Konsequenzen dieser voreingenommenen selektiven Wahrnehmung besser zu verstehen. Die Studie untersucht die Beziehung zwischen voreingenommener selektiver Wahrnehmung und politischer Polarisierung mittels Daten der Nationalen Annenberg Wahlbefragung. Querschnittsanalysen geben deutliche Hinweise darauf, dass voreingenommene selektive Wahrnehmung in Zusammenhang mit Polarisierung steht. Analysen im Zeitverlauf dokumentieren, dass voreingenommene selektive Wahrnehmung zu Polarisierung führt. Einige Hinweise stützen auch die umgekehrte Kausalrichtung, nämlich dass Polarisierung zu voreingenommener selektiver Wahrnehmung führt. Implikationen für die Untersuchung von Medienwirkungen und normative Implikationen – positiv als auch negativ – werden diskutiert.

In the uninformed condition, detectors were free to use their intuitive strategies. In the informed condition, they were given detailed instructions about valid nonverbal cues. In the informed feedback condition, they received additional outcome feedback. Performance was generally above chance but further improved through cue information and feedback.

Our analysis offers two lessons. First, a caution. We detect a number of potentially important differences in the response characteristics of these three groups. Researchers using multi-mode survey techniques should keep in mind that subtle effects might be at play in their analyses. Second, an encouragement.

His prioritizing of oral argumentative discourse over written forms of nonargumentative “indirect communication” leaves little space for the kind of “constellational” cognition and “combinational” articulation considered essential by the earlier theorists.

These models emerge from analysis of 395 sites on the World Wide Web (Web). Key factors underlying the models are interactivity, ideologies related to intellectual property, and audience size. Relationships between these factors and funding of sites were tested by examining data collected through both content analysis of Web sites and surveys of individuals who manage the creation of content at those sites.

The data reported in this study indicate that multiple funding models can co-exist in the current CMC environment. These include content that supports organizational objectives in Sales and Promotion sites, pre-packed information and entertainment in Sponsored Content sites, a wealth of information in Public Information sites, and content provided by individuals and non-profit groups in Community Content sites.

However, the future infrastructure of CMC may play a major role in the funding of content. If systems of the future significantly increase the cost of developing and/or receiving content, the diversity of CMC could be lost. Public Information and Community Content sites may become too costly to maintain and commercial voices may gain dominance in Sales and Promotion and Sponsored Content sites. Thus, responsible public decisions should be made in the public sphere about how future CMC infrastructures are to be financed.",3.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1998.tb00090.x,

A group “task” is a decision–making task for which no externally correct decision exists and whose completion, therefore, is dependent on acceptance. Thus, it is concluded that the task and socio–emotional dimensions of a group are inseparably interdependent in that both are grounded in the process of group formation and maintenance.

Adopting a pragmatist perspective, we propose to treat phenomena as being composed of relations; that is, as being constituted by passing through various things and beings. Extending Latour’s work on modernity, we argue that interaction analysts aim to capture social phenomena at the junction between two modes of existence or two manners of passing through others. In the mode of subsistence, social phenomena are (re)produced by continuously passing through new elements. In the mode of reference, social phenomena sustain themselves by going back and forth between various inscriptions. Based on a case study, we show how the movement of subsistence always eludes that of reference, and how analysts can only move along with this movement by limiting their corroboration techniques, both in number and in range. Thus, this paper makes an important contribution to research on language and social interaction, as well as science and technology studies.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqz045,

Results provide support for the proposition that tobacco control policies and behaviors of opinion leaders can be categorized according to stages in the innovation decision process. As hypothesized, the level of mass media–generated interpersonal communication was dependent upon an individual's stage of adoption such that the frequency of ad discussion increased with advancing stages on the continuum. Regression analyses also confirmed a strong positive associative trend between ad discussion and stage of adoption. Further analysis provided evidence that the impact of campaign exposure on adoption of antitobacco norms was mediated through discussion of the ads, highlighting the importance of social diffusion processes.

Each tradition of communication theory derives from and appeals rhetorically to certain commonplace beliefs about communication while challenging other beliefs. The complementarities and tensions among traditions generate a theoretical metadiscourse that intersects with and potentially informs the ongoing practical metadiscourse in society. In a tentative scheme of the field, rhetorical, semiotic, phenomenological, cybernetic, socio-psychological, sociocultural, and critical traditions of communication theory are distinguished by characteristic ways of defining communication and problems of communication, metadiscursive vocabularies, and metadiscursive commonplaces that they appeal to and challenge.

Thus, on a global scale, the public health crisis has been converted into various spectacles of ostensible border “crisis.” Rather than seeing borders as purely a matter of control, however, it is instructive to situate the tactics of border enforcement in relation to the primacy, autonomy, and subjectivity of human mobility. If we start from the human freedom of movement and recognize border enforcement as a reaction formation, various tactics of border policing can be seen to introduce interruptions that temporarily decelerate cross-border mobilities.

We derived our manipulation of interactivity from Rafaeli’s (1988) definition of interactivity as message contingency. Participants reported significantly greater intent to participate in an online community featuring interactive messages, but only when response rate was slow. These results indicate that both structural features of interfaces and content features of interactions affect people’s intent to participate in online communities.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00313.x,

In this article, we integrate and extend this research by developing a campaign communication mediation model of civic and campaign participation. Two data sets are merged for this inquiry: (a) content-coded ad-buy data on the placement of campaign messages on a market-by-market and program-by-program basis and (b) a national panel study concerning patterns of traditional and digital media consumption and levels of civic and campaign participation. Exposure to televised campaign advertising is estimated by developing an algorithm based on the market and program placement of specific ads and geocoded survey respondents’ viewing of certain categories of television content in which these ads were concentrated. Structural equation models reveal that advertising exposure drives online news use in ways that complement conventional news influences on political discussion and political messaging.

Further, alternative specifications reveal that our original model produces the best fit, empirically and theoretically.

This study addressed these contradictions by positing subjective hope as a moderator of anger’s effects on message processing and persuasion. Employing an experimental design (N = 538) in the context of the U.S. immigration debate, the study assessed two long-standing mechanisms associated with the persuasive effects of anger—psychological reactance and message elaboration—with subjective hope as a moderator of those processes. Results confirmed that experienced anger increases reactance and superficial information processing. Critically, however, subjective hope emerged as a key moderator capable of reversing anger’s negative effects.

The Electronic Networking Project, funded by the International Development Research Centre and implemented by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development, was key in joining these two sectors. This article outlines the growth of both sectors, and analyzes how NGOs view the Internet and how they are using it. There is an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards these technologies among NGOs and a view that they are primarily useful in allowing individuals and organizations to access a great deal of information easily for the first time, and also for maintaining contacts and creating networks internationally. Issues for NGOs regarding the Internet include the cost of telephone calls and integration of the use of the Internet and the development and maintenance of Websites into other office routines. Finally, a common perspective about knowledge sharing in Nepal is explored as it relates to the use of the Internet and the structure of Websites in Nepal.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2002.tb00141.x,

We argue that reliance on social media for news does not contribute to people’s real level of political knowledge (objective knowledge), but instead only influences people’s impression of being informed (subjective knowledge). Subjective knowledge is just as important for driving political participation, a potentially troubling trend given the nature of news consumption on social media.

This article examines three brands that circulate “aspirational realness” around their product: Glossier, Reformation, and Maryam Nassir Zadeh.

A self-report measure of presence yielded two factors. Using [Gerrig's (1993)] terminology for the sense of being transported to a mediated environments, we labeled the two factors “arrival,” for the feeling of being there in the virtual environment, and “departure,” for the feeling of not being there in the in physical environment. It appears that being in the virtual environment is not equivalent to not being in the physical environment. A path analysis found that these two factors have very different relationships to viewer memory for the experience and for attitude change (i.e., buying intention and confidence in product decision).

Second, we find that people who comment on articles in the real world use more toxic language on average than the public as a whole; levels of toxicity in comments scraped from media outlet Facebook pages greatly exceed what is observed in comments we elicit on the same articles from a nationally representative sample.

Several findings were noteworthy. First, although they were relatively consistent in their nonverbal responses to different patients, physicians generally reciprocated patient's adjustments in response latency, pauses during speaking turns, body orientation, and interruptions and compensated patient's modifications in turn duration and gestural rates. Second, physicians nonverbally interacted with patients over 30 years of age in a less domineering and more responsive fashion (e.g., comparable turn durations, more vocal back-channels, and more nonverbal behavior reciprocity) than they did when conversing with patients under 30. Third, physicians appeared responsive to patients experiencing various degrees of anxiety. Specifically, relative to their interactions with less worried patients, physicians used less task touch with anxious patients and to a greater degree compensated the worried patients nonverbal responses.

The Arousal Model is further discriminated into an Emotional Arousal Model, in which the agent of arousal is emotional reaction to violent content, and the Form Arousal Model, in which arousal is a result of the cognitive effort involved in decoding programming. The Facilitation, Catharsis, and Form Arousal Models are contrasted on a sample of 597 adolescents. The results indicate independent Facilitation and Form Arousal processes occur. A rather startling result is the finding that levels of aggressiveness can be predicted as well by examining only the form of programming as they can by examining only the violent content.

Additionally, accountability had a small, insubstantial effect on member performance. Interaction analyses further suggested that dense teams hold the ability to constrain members to either high or low performance standards. Specifically, members received the best performance evaluations when placed on dense teams with high standards of performance. Team density and team accountability also interacted to impact performance evaluations, but in the opposite direction of what was predicted.

We addressed this issue by integrating logic from attribution theory with ADT. Three studies examined whether causal factors identified in attribution theory’s covariation model (consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency) affected internal/external attributions (for a character’s harmful behavior) to shape liking for characters seen inflicting extreme harm. In Study 1, a 2 × 2 × 2 experiment varied (high vs low) the perceptions of consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency associated with a protagonist’s harmful acts to examine their effect on liking for a well-known hero. In a 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 experiment using an unknown character, Studies 2 and 3 added to Study 1’s design by varying character type (imperfect hero, morally equivocal character, villain). Findings indicate narrative cues serve as antecedent factors that prompt either internal or external attributions for a protagonist’s harmful behavior. Internal attributions negatively predict character liking, whereas external attributions are positive predictors. Findings suggest that writers, when they want viewers to like characters, may use attribution theory principles to signal that external factors caused the character’s harmful acts. We discuss this belief as an alternative to models that explain the appeal of protagonists who behave immorally, reasoning that initially-activated character schema can bias audiences in favor of a protagonist and minimize the importance of moral judgment.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqy049,

There are two main themes in this analysis. In the first instance, the post-structuralist approach insists on seeing current professional journalistic norms as examples of hegemonic discursive formations that achieve ascendancy over other options. Through this perspective, one can interrogate how ethnic media and journalism are excluded from democratic public debates on the basis of contingent communicative values dressed up as objective norms. Secondly, Mouffe’s work provides a theoretical basis for aligning journalistic contingency with a plural agonistic democracy.

Levine et al. (2003) highlight the alleged methodological limitations of the current body of the self-construal model of culture. Their allegations, whether true or not, require a fair investigation. Careful examination of Levine et al. reveals pervasive logical flaws, methodological errors, and interpretation biases, which stem from ethnic stereotyping and other erroneous assumptions at various junctures. These fundamental errors, in turn, render their conclusions untenable. In testing their 1st set of hypotheses, which they proclaim to be “central to the validity” of self-construal scales, Levine et al. bifurcate the participants into “Westerners” versus “Asians,” and then impose their a priori stereotype of how Westerners ought to be versus how Asians ought to be, which is scientifically unacceptable. This is an unscientific validation criterion (comparable to crude ethnic stereotypes such as “Asians are smarter”) and should not be used to judge the scales' validity. Next, in their discussion of priming, Levine et al. assert that the construct validity of the interdependent self-construal requires that it must be susceptible to priming. This is an elementary logical fallacy. It simply does not follow from the definition of the interdependent self-construal and therefore cannot be used as a criterion which reflects on construct validity. Their priming experiments are also deeply flawed by the unrepresentative sample of participants. Further, in their factor analyses, Levine et al. set up the “straw man” of a “universal a priori 2-factor solution” although no self-construal scholar or theory insists that there are precisely 2 universally applicable self-construals or that the current self-construal scales are perfect. The results of statistical analyses, such as those in Levine et al., crucially depend on the selection of presuppositions. Levine et al.'s presuppositions are untenable, yet they are passed off as self-evident criteria for validity testing.

However, little research has focused on the effects of message style; that is, how esteem support messages are delivered. The present experiment addresses this lacuna by manipulating message style in a laboratory study examining face-to-face esteem support interactions. Confederates were trained to provide emotion-focused esteem support to naïve participants (N = 173) in four styles along the assertive–inductive dimension, in addition to a listening-only control condition. We then assessed the effect of the interaction on participants’ state self-esteem. Results indicated that emotion-focused esteem support improved state self-esteem more than listening support; however, there was no significant effect of message style. Post-interaction state self-esteem improvement was positively associated with the quantity of emotion-focused esteem support content provided during the interaction.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqab001,

We examined journalists’ narratives from qualitative in-depth interviews with 20 Swiss newspaper journalists, who were asked to interpret the perceived gap—found in previous studies—between journalism ideals and journalism practice. The results compelled us to revisit role theories and to consider a number of overlooked or under-utilized analytic features of social roles to propose refinements to the concepts of journalistic roles and role performance.

We use text analyses to characterize the frequency, toxicity, and tone of comments in the chat. Our experimental findings indicate that Democratic subjects assigned to the Facebook (social) chat condition reported lower affect toward Democrats and a worse viewing experience, aligned with the toxic and overwhelming nature of the chat.

To test these hypotheses, a 2-year panel study using an undergraduate sample was conducted. Cross-lagged path models showed that exposure to sexually objectifying television measured during Year 1 increased trait self-objectification (trait SO) during Year 2 for both women and men. At the same time, trait SO during Year 1 decreased exposure to sexually objectifying television during Year 2, suggesting that both male and female participants selectively avoided sexually objectifying television based on antecedent trait SO.

Participants in the study (410 college students) read a conversation containing comforting messages representing one of three levels of behavioral complexity; they subsequently wrote impressions of the source of these messages and these impressions were scored for the number of attributes they contained. Interpersonal cognitive complexity was assessed with Crockett's (1965) Role Category Questionnaire. Consistent with hypotheses, main effects for behavioral complexity and cognitive complexity were observed on impression differentiation; in addition, the anticipated interaction between message complexity and cognitive complexity was observed.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1989.tb00201.x,

The original study found that a threat appeal about climate change can increase risk perception and activism intentions and that a humor appeal can also increase activism intentions with a large sample of young adults. Using the same stimuli, measures, and experimental design with a similar sample, we fail to replicate these main effects. We do, however, replicate age as a moderator of humor’s effect on perceived risk, such that the humor appeal only persuaded emerging adults (ages 18–21.9).

Doctored videos sent over the platform have elicited visceral responses among users, resulting in the wrongful death of innocent people. Would the responses have been so strong if the false news were circulated in text or audio? Is video modality the reason for such powerful effects? We explored this question by comparing reactions to three false stories prepared in either text-only, audio-only, or video formats, among rural and urban users in India. Our findings reveal that video is processed more superficially, and therefore users believe in it more readily and share it with others. Aside from advancing our theoretical understanding of modality effects in the context of mobile media, our findings also hold practical implications for design of modality-based flagging of fake news, and literacy campaigns to inoculate users against misinformation.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmab010,

Findings suggest that from a long-term perspective, and for goods that involve communication and interaction, the incentive structure may not be so favorable for free riders.

The argument draws on historical, cultural, and literary scholarship to define the relationship between poetry and journalism, review historical uses of poetry in newspapers, show how poetry developed as a boundary object that “objective” news has defined itself against, and present four mini-case studies of poetry doing journalistic work in the 21st century.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtab006,

Through these fantasies, the rhetorical community resisted female subordination found in traditional romance narratives while embracing the need for love, partnership, and physical intimacy. As the heroines in these fantasies, women were constructed as independent, vital, and fulfilled, yet wanting to find heterosexual partnerships.

Specifically, this study shows how satirically revealing the “weak spot” of populism (i.e., lacking concrete treatment recommendations) lowers populist support particularly among citizens already inclined to vote for populist parties.

Taking the perspective of the reinforcing spirals model (RSM) focusing on media effects and selection, we compare six statistical models that were recently used to analyze the RSM and show their ability to separate within- and between-person components. Using empirical data capturing respondents’ development during adolescence, we show that results vary across statistical models.

It was expected that the most secure partners would have secure attachments with their parents and partners who report their own secure romantic attachment, that the most preoccupied partners would have been anxious-ambivalent in their attachment to their parents and paired with dismissively avoidant others, and that the most dismissively avoidant partners would have been role reversed by their parents and paired with preoccupied partners. Support for this expanded model was found, in that parental and partner attachments both influenced the final form of romantic attachment, with partner attachment appearing to have more influence than parental attachment.

Serving the rhetorical function of field guides and training manuals, teen magazines limit women's sociality and sexuality within narrowly defined heterosexual norms and practices. The rhetoric of sexual etiquette encourages young women to be sex objects and teachers of interpersonal communication rather than lovers, friends, and partners.

Specifically, I am interested in everyday resistance strategies as “seemingly innocuous” communication, which is understood from theorizations of “hidden transcripts” that black publics utilize to counteract dominance. In order to explore “everyday resistance” I employed focus groups with 20 Black women and present patterns of resistance strategies online, such as visual signifiers and posting news articles. Secondly, I interrogate how these resistance strategies “talk back” to and circumvent the underpinnings of digital media culture through the postracial logics of individuality and networked influence. Ultimately, Black women’s interconnected identities reveal the flaws of digital culture as postracial by demonstrating their resistance strategies that must work around any assumption of a “postracial parity.”",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ccc/tcz046,

Males, who are in the minority, must work harder to take the floor, even in their attempted flirtatious interactions.

Results indicate that relational intimacy increased over time, but a significant interaction with medium and subsequent analyses reveal that this was only true for the CMC condition. Task type also interacted with time, but it did not have a significant effect on relational intimacy, nor did it interact with medium.

Consequently, this article presents a variety of conceptual tools for applying evolutionary theory to organizations, organizational communities, and their networks, including the notions of relational carrying capacity and linkage fitness. It illustrates evolutionary principles, such as variation, selection, and retention, that lead to the formation, growth, maintenance, and eventual demise of communication and other network linkages.

This pattern did not emerge for recognition of video content. However, the tendency to interpret video depictions in terms of the inconsistent audio information increased with age. On a measure of free recall, mention of the content of both channels, rather than only one channel, also increased with age. Finally, for all three age groups, personality ratings of the central character were less extreme among respondents exposed to the mismatch version of the program than among those exposed to the audio-only or video-only versions (in which the character exhibited only one type of behavior). Overall, the results were interpreted as indicating a developmental increase in utilization of the semantic content of both channels to form a unified representation of the events in the narrative. However, evaluations of the character's personality suggest that children at all three age levels integrated the content of both channels to some degree.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1989.tb00211.x,

Reconsiderations of family systems theory focus on the following concerns: (a) the emphasis on homeostatic processes in the family at the expense of understanding the family as a system that is continually changing, (b) the tendency to dichotomize between an individual perspective and a family systems perspective, (c) the potential for gender bias in family systems theory, (d) the challenge that social inequities and cultural diversity present for systems theorists, and (e) skepticism about the practice of defining reality and problems in the family exclusively from the privileged position of the researcher.

Social construction theory and an analysis of dialectical process are discussed as providing epistemological and substantive perspectives that can be corrective of some of the constraining aspects of family systems theory. A constructionist family systems perspective would incorporate social construction and dialectical perspectives into a process model for understanding family communication which: (a) views family process as evolutionary rather than circular, (b) explores the individual-system dialectic and the presence of dilemmas and contradictions in family relationships, (c) recognizes the potential for gender and cultural bias as one theorizes about relationships and families, (d) suggests that meanings and problems do not have objective realities of their own but are linguistically constructed, and (e) views the therapist-researcher not as an objective observer but as part of the system that is being observed. This paper argues that family systems theory is not a static model but one that is continually evolving and changing.

The arguments made here develop a series of related concepts — the work of waiting, an ethics of relief, and areligious religiosity — that begin to address this need at the heart of critical theory. Built around a series of philosophical circumscriptions that sketch the outlines of these concepts, I argue that to participate in the radical continuation of the Enlightenment we need to return to an unlikely place — religion. To achieve this return, I offer an explication of Heidegger's address, The Principle of Reason (1996), focusing on his discussion of calculative reason, and Freud's Future of an lllusion (1961). This gives the vital context for understanding the various meanings comported by the metaphor of an ethics of relief. In light of this, I demonstrate that there is a space reserved for these ideas within contemporary critical theory as represented by the discourse ethics of Habermas. By intersecting the position I develop with two points in Habermas's work, I show that the concepts of the work of waiting, an ethics of relief, and areligious religiosity can begin a response to the need identified at the heart of critical theory.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1997.tb00157.x,

If status conferral occurs, it has serious implications for traditional conceptions of how the press should function in a democracy. In two experiments, the author reported evidence supporting the existence of a status conferral effect. Status conferral was tested indirectly by varying the prestige of the news agency providing the coverage and observing differences in the perceived status of persons covered.

However, there were ambiguities in previous results and the present experiment was intended to clarify them. Conferral differences appeared consistently on two of three indices in previous work—“Safety” and “Dynamism”—but not on the third, “Qualification.” In previous studies, the topics sources that were being recognized as qualified for discussion were always of broad, national application or scope. Thus if Qualification conferral were related to topic scope, no differences would have been observed because topic scope was constant. To test this, the present experiment varied both the news agency providing the coverage and the scope or application of the news topic. What the source said, substantively, remained the same. Scope was varied by having him say it about “US. cities” or the city in which the newspaper was published.

Although researchers have cast IOCs as a broadly-inclusive process in which organizations decide to join forces through mutual agreements, many IOCs are not equal partnerships, but are led by a single organization or a tight collection of organizations that have already been convened. This paper explores how new organizations that wish to join ongoing IOCs can navigate their entry when they are not seen as needed or important. Drawing on qualitative data collected through field research of regional planning, including interviews with conveners (urban planners who are the main organizers of IOCs and charged with vetting new potential members) and representatives of 12 different organizations that tried to break into ongoing IOCs, this paper proposes a process model inducted from the findings that describes the communicative practices that enabled and constrained organizations’ entries into ongoing IOCs.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqy052,

In particular, this article argues that places of memory are not finished texts, but sites of re-collection in which individuals and groups selectively cull and organize re-collected versions of the past. Grounded in Michael McGee's concept of rhetorical fragments, the theory of re-collection involves attending to discursive fragments of memory that circulate within and around the memory site—as well as the fragments brought to the site by individuals and collectives. Re-collection thus requires analytical tools beyond those traditionally used in rhetorical criticism—as is illustrated in a case study proposal for exploring the process of re-collection surrounding the Space Window in Washington National Cathedral.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2009.01345.x,

Then, we focus on complex figurative frames (combinations of metaphor, hyperbole, and/or irony).

In this article, we propose a concept of creativity as emerging from networked connections, (im)mobility, and situations of hardship. We, thus, make a connection between mobility and space as networked elements of creativity as opposed to individual agent models. We focus on how unplanned or emergent uses of digital technologies reveal how creative practices emerge, particularly in the context of mobile technology use where people are physically mobile and yet connected via the Internet. We define the concept of creativity as a constant process of becoming, a “recursive organization” that can be seen in groups such as migrants, or people living in disenfranchised communities that survive in make-shift locations such refugee camps or slums. Contrary to the affluent and capitalistic-embedded traditional ideas of creativity, mobile networked creativity is a practice that is found mostly in situations of economic hardship, power imbalances, and (im)mobilities.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtaa006,

In each case there is, I believe, a stream of events that is random in certain aspects and in each case there is a nonrandom selective process which causes certain of the random selective components to “survive” longer than others. Without the random, there can be no new thing. (1980, p. 163)

I begin from a discrimination I owe to Horst Mittelstaedt, who pointed out that there are two “sorts” of methods of perfecting an adaptive act. Let us suppose that the act is the shooting of a bird. In the first case this is to be done with a rifle. The marksman will look along the sights of his rifle and will note an error in its aim. He will correct the error, perhaps creating a new error which again he will correct, until he is satisfied. He will then press the trigger and shoot.

What is significant is that the act of self-correction occurs within the single act of shooting. Mittelstaedt uses the term Feedback to characterize this whole genus of methods of perfecting an adaptive act.

In contrast, consider the man who is shooting a flying bird with a shotgun or who uses a revolver held under the table where he cannot correct its aim. In such cases, what must happen is that any aggregate of information is taken in through sense organs; that upon this information, computation is completed; and that upon the (approximate) result of that computation, the gun is fired…, The man who would acquire skill with a shotgun or in the art of shooting pistols under the table must practice his art again and again, shooting at skeet or some dummy target. By long practice, he must adjust the setting of his nerves and muscles so that in the critical event, he will “automatically” give an optimum performance. This genus of methods Mittelstaedt calls Calibration. (Ibid., pp. 215–216)

There are subcycles of living and dying within the bigger, more enduring ecology. But what shall we say of the death of the larger system? Our biosphere? Perhaps under the eye of heaven, or Shiva, it doesn't matter. But it's the only one we know. (Ibid., p. 230)",5.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01284.x,

The influencer “imaginary” sheds light on how individuals experience and justify the commodification of the self and forms of knowledge as subject to valuation in markets when they communicate their brands.

Trust was higher within closer social circles: trust was highest in teammates, followed by other players across the game, followed by others online. Self-disclosure was positively related to trust of teammates and others in the game, while voice chat was only related to teammate trust.

Through the use of videophone technology caregivers participated in video-recorded team meetings. The actual communication behaviors of caregivers and team members were analyzed for active participation. Findings revealed that team–prompted caregiver participation was most common, however, team use of supportive talk in this context was considerably less frequent. The study also found that the team's use of active participation behaviors elicits caregiver active participation behaviors.

Based on self-perception theory, it was predicted and found that intimacy of the subject's self-disclosure would be positively correlated with attraction for the confederate when the subject disclosed before her partner but not when she disclosed after her partner. A second prediction that subjects would be attracted toward a highly intimate partner only if they had previously disclosed was not confirmed. Instead, attraction for the confederate was greater when she had disclosed before the subject and when she had disclosed intimately.

The impact of two factors on group decision quality, information exchange, and perceptions of influence was examined: (a) status differences among members (equal-status vs. mixed-status groups) and (b) communication media (face-to-face vs. computer-mediated communication). Three-person groups were composed such that the critical information required to make the best decision was given only to the low-status member in the mixed-status groups and randomly assigned to one member in the equal-status groups. The results indicated that the mixed-status groups made poorer decisions and made fewer references to critical information than equal-status groups, regardless of the communication medium. Computer-mediated communication suppressed information exchange and the perceived influence of group members, suggesting that the relation between status and communication media is more complex than proposed in past research.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00392.x,

As hypothesized, dysfunctional relationship beliefs exhibited positive correlations with the destructive problem-solving responses of exit and neglect and negative correlations with the constructive problem-solving response of voice. Canonical correlation analysis suggested that individuals possessing the beliefs that disagreement is destructive and partners cannot change were likely to respond to relational problems with exit and neglect and to eschew responding with voice. Both dysfunctional beliefs and problem-solving responses were associated with relational satisfaction. However, dysfunctional beliefs failed to predict satisfaction when controlling for problem-solving responses.

An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how “operational pragmatics” can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures.

Expectancy theory was offered as an explanation for this interaction. Because changes in vocalic patterns can violate expectations, receivers make consistent interpretations of these vocalic cues, and evaluations of these interpretations may be affected by decoder predispositions toward communication that, in turn, produce differential perceptions of source reward. Respondents were interviewed by trained encoders who used neutral, pleasant, and hostile vocal patterns. Compliance was assessed by asking for a donation of time to communication research. Follow-up surveys measured perceived relational messages, interviewer credibility, vocal pleasantness, and the degree to which the vocalic pattern was expected. The predicted disordinal interaction between decoding ability and voice condition was found. Decoding ability did not correlate with predispositions, nullifying source reward as a factor in the evaluation of vocalic violations. It was suggested that preferences for vocalic patterns influenced evaluations: Good decoders may have preferred affiliative cues and thus complied more with pleasant voices, whereas poor decoders may have preferred assertive patterns and complied more with hostile voices.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1986.tb00098.x,

Among others, banks with traditionally high cost-effectiveness and that already offer wide private ATM coverage for their customers are also the ones which have already started to migrate a larger proportion of their customer base on-line. Interestingly, among all “push” factors analyzed, cost-effectiveness emerges as the largest leverage effect on customer conversion. Finally, a cluster analysis supplements the regression results along the axes of “pull” and “push”, and identifies a set of early movers and laggards among the banks in our sample. Generally speaking, those first-movers already exhibit stronger off-line profitability than laggards, which may indicate that the on-line marketplace may reproduce performance off-line (i.e., currently successful banks have nothing to fear from aggressive start-ups).",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2001.tb00133.x,

The theory holds that citizens will be more likely to accept the rightfulness of a political order to the extent that they recognize its orientation as being communicative, oriented to increasing reciprocal understanding with the public. Assessments of communicative action are indicated by 2 conditions: whether citizens agree with government claims and whether citizens perceive opportunities to engage in dialog with policymakers in public discourse. The communicative action approach is tested using the case of Singapore government's action on smoking control.

Communication scholars have a long history of theoretical inquiry into how flow biases media selection, how different media content results in flow, and how flow influences media processing and effects. However, the neurobiological basis of flow during media use is not well understood, limiting our explanatory capacity to specify how media contribute to flow or well-being. Here, we show that flow is associated with a flexible and modular brain-network topology, which may offer an explanation for why flow is simultaneously perceived as high-control and effortless, even when the task difficulty is high.

The effect is largely consistent for network and cable outlets alike, suggesting that gatekeeping processes under both market and advocacy models bias content towards the extreme and conflictual.

Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that teacher confirmation is best represented by a 3-factor solution: (a) teachers' response to students' questions-comments, (b) demonstrated interest in students and in their learning, and teaching style. Results also indicate that teacher confirmation plays a significant role in college students' cognitive and affective learning. For Sample 1, confirmation uniquely explained 18% of the variance in cognitive learning and 30% of the variance in affective learning, after controlling for demographic variables and relevance of assignments. For Sample 2, confirmation uniquely explained 17% of the variance in cognitive learning and 31% of the variance in affective learning, after controlling for the same variables. Structural equation modeling revealed strong, significant paths between confirmation and affective learning and between affective and cognitive learning.

We applied symbolic convergence theory with its critical method, fantasy theme analysis (FTA), because of its facility to explore and understand meaning constructed through the convergence and competition of alternate symbolic worlds. Through this method, not previously used as a means of tracking the rhetorical visions of competing political campaign TV spots, we explain the master analogue that underpins the advertising rhetoric and offer insights into how candidates and voters make policy choices and the rationales they use to defend them.

However, a key issue that needs to be resolved is the question of interoperability. Interoperability is defined as the set of protocols that ensure end-to-end provision of a given service in a consistent and predictable way. These protocols not only include a set of technical specifications but also include a set of contractual procedures to ensure fair, transparent and consistent interconnection as well as an institutional framework that ensures fair competition. Thus interoperability can be seen to take a variety of policy formats as the market evolves.

Although prior meta-analyses report that the average effect of fear appeals is moderately positive, the role of efficacy information is not completely understood. Prior work and fear appeal theories have argued that the presence of both response and self-efficacy information improves fear appeal success but the individual impacts of each have not been properly estimated. A meta-analysis (k = 158, N = 19,736) was conducted to examine the individual and combined effects of response and self-efficacy information contained in fear appeals on behavioral intentions and behaviors. Estimating the impact of fear appeals relative to low and no fear controls, the meta-analysis showed that fear appeals had a stronger influence on behavioral outcomes when they included positive response efficacy information but did not vary as a function of including self-efficacy information or negative response efficacy information.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqab048,

The investigation involved three related studies. In the first study, an attempt was made to confirm the existence of systematic relationships between the quality of group decisions and the satisfaction of four functional requirements. The results supported the existence of significant positive relationships between group decision-making performance and the satisfaction of these decisional functions. In the second study, an attempt was made to establish the independent main effects of each of those four functions. Using a three-dimensional interaction coding scheme, it was found that variations in group decision quality can be independently accounted for by the quality of interaction in regards to three functions—problem analysis, evaluation of positive qualities, and evaluation of negative qualities. In the third study, an attempt was made to demonstrate that the quality of group decisions can be traced to the effective or ineffective satisfaction of decisional functions. The results provide conclusive evidence (at least at the level of primary reasoning), that the quality of a group's decision is a direct result of the group's ability (or inability) to perform important decisional functions.

We build theory by relying on past research and using a Q-method to capture the subjective perspectives of people who experience communication overload. In our refinement of this abstract concept, we identified seven dimensions composing communication overload. The dimensions included: compromising message quality, having many distractions, using many information and communication technologies, pressuring for decisions, feeling responsible to respond, overwhelming with information, and piling up of messages. Our reconceptualization integrates disparate research, links the availability–expectation–pressure pattern to overload, and elaborates on communication quality, quantity, and generalized perceptions of feeling overwhelmed.

Despite its predictive utility, the theory has yet to account for an essential component of narratives: character interdependence. Extant models treat disposition formation toward individual characters as an independent process. In the current paper, we posit that affective dispositions formed toward one character (e.g., a protagonist) are interdependent with affective dispositions formed toward others (e.g., an antagonist). We present two experimental studies that provide evidence of character interdependence. We show that dispositions toward a single character account for unique variance in dispositions toward another, and that the same character can be perceived as highly moral or immoral, depending on a comparison character. In the discussion section, we integrate our character interdependence model with extant theories to generate novel predictions for affective disposition theory and other areas of research relevant to communication.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqaa005,

This pattern of message plan alteration is predicated on the notion that higher level alterations are more demanding of scarce cognitive resources. This postulate was examined directly in two laboratory and two field experiments in which geographic direction givers were led to believe their directions had been misunderstood because of communication failures located at different levels in the message plan hierarchy. Consistent with the hierarchy principle and the effort postulate, direction givers required to make more abstract alterations to their directions (route changes) showed higher levels of cognitive load as indexed by speech onset latency than direction givers required to make lower level alterations (landmarks and speech rate). The effects of time constraints, preinteraction planning, and failure pervasiveness were also examined.

The construct validity of television viewing can be derived from a conceptualization of what it is in television which, when viewed, or exposed to, interacts with human behavior and attributes. Four such conceptualizations are illustrated, each leading to a different construct of “viewing”: (1) television as a social-situational factor involving choice behavior between activities; (2) television as a transmission of a content repertoire, implying decision-making regarding messages; (3) television as a source of content-messages dealing with recall, comprehension, and attitude change; and (4) television as a “language” pertaining to the processes of encoding messages in the service of extracting knowledge.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1978.tb00615.x,

This report follows up the first-year results in an effort to assess the permanence of the initial effects. The results during the second year revealed main effects for inoculation on attitudes, suggesting modest persistence for the initial pretreatments, and a weak interaction effect in the fall, which dissipated by spring. In addition, the pattern of results suggests that if resistance approaches are to have a chance of success in smoking prevention they must target young adolescents at the point of transition from primary (elementary) to secondary (middle or junior high) school. Beyond this pivotal juncture, adolescents’attitudes opposing smoking quickly deteriorate, therefore rendering the resistance paradigm inappropriate.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1994.tb00329.x,

Indeed, as the one of leading nations for high-speed broadband access, South Korean Internet users virtually dominate the entire gamut of Internet activities-everything from web searches to games to Instant Messenger (IM) chatting-and are one of the leading consumers of on-line shopping for services and goods (“e-commerce”). Even popular social movements have gone “on-line” in South Korea with civil organizations effectively mobilizing their resources through Internet networking.

However, a widespread disparity in Internet use has recently come to light in South Korea. In particular, Internet use has been clearly divided by generations, which threatens to create a “new” generation gap and the possibility of further generational conflict in a society already marked by deep generational cleavages. In this paper, we touch upon the adoption of the Internet on the basis of research data that examines the digital divide on a national scale. We examine socio-demographic factors, attitudes toward the Internet, social supports (family support, in particular), and the influence that Internet access has had on the South Korean populace, paying particular attention to diffusion theory which has been considered the most feasible explanation for South Korea's rapid Internet adoption. This research indicates that Internet adoption in South Korea is influenced more by family support than by other characteristics.

The increased presence of bots is the main explanatory variable for these seemingly contradictory tendencies. In short, individuals introduce bots to make communication more simple and predictable but end up with a large-scale dynamic that is more complex and more uncertain.

This evolution, however, has circulated to a limited extent beyond borders, as noted by North American scholars in the 1990s. Attentive to this problem, this article reviews how Latin America has featured in Communication Theory’s archive since 1992 and introduces a Special Issue that incorporates recent contributions from the region into the journal’s corpus. The analysis shows the extremely limited presence of Latin America in Communication Theory both in terms of substantial contributions to theory-building arising from the region, and of Latin American authorship. We argue that this state of affairs evidences the need for explicit editorial policies aimed at addressing the gap, and for increased cross-border interaction among scholars.

We explored the problem of distinguishing between anti- and pro-vaccination activists based on a social network of videos and associated comments posted on YouTube. Videos for the analysis were selected by submitting the term “vaccination” to a search on YouTube. A content analysis of the selected videos was then performed (Keelan et al, 2007) to classify videos as pro- or anti-vaccination. Then, a modified version of the SCAN method (Chin and Chignell, 2008) for identifying cohesive subgroups in social networks was applied to the social network inferred from the discussions about the videos. Results showed that a cohesive subgroup of anti-vaccination people existed in discussions around anti-vaccination videos, whereas discussions around pro-vaccination videos included both anti-vaccination and pro-vaccination people.

Twenty high socially competent and 20 low socially competent college men were given either positive or negative feedback by a woman confederate in a five-minute dyadic interaction. The confederate made either four all-positive or all-negative statements on the impression she was forming about the men during the interaction. Measures were taken of the amount of time the men spoke, the latency of their response to the confederate's statements, and the number of topics and topic changes used during the interaction. Judgements were also made on the men's physical attractiveness and social skill. Finally, the men's verbal reactions to the confederate statements were content analyzed for direction (self, confederate, or other) and valence (positive, negative, or neutral). A 2-by-2-by-4 (competence by feedback by statements) ANOVA indicated that subjects differed over trials (statements) in their reaction latencies as a function of their competence level and feedback: low competent men took considerably longer to react to the confederate's negative feedback than did men in other conditions. There were no differences among groups on the amount of conversation time or number of topics and topic changes. High competent men were judged to be more attractive and more socially skilled than low competent men. Content analysis revealed that high competent and low competent men did not differ in their verbal responses when receiving positive feedback. During negative feedback, however, high competent men employed a wider range of responses than low competent men. These findings suggest that high and low socially competent men may differ in their responses to evaluative feedback such that high competent men are both quicker to respond and have a broader repertoire of response than do low competent men.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1977.tb00593.x,

In today’s high-choice media environments, exposure to diverse news is largely determined by individuals’ personal selection. Yet these decisions are increasingly shaped by online platforms, whose curation mechanisms may serve to expand or contract the diversity of encountered content. In a major extension of existing research, we show that positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000 German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant influence.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqac009,

Against the backdrops of network theory—particularly strong and weak ties—and a related fragmentation model, this article urges scholarly exploration of updated network behaviors and their possible influence on at least one related area of communication research.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01410.x,

In this article, I explore another possibility: as Internet quality improves, we spend more time online and consume more information, which subsequently increases knowledge and turnout. To test this possibility, I link geocoded Internet download speed data with survey data.

Structural equation analyses were conducted on the cognitive, affective-anger, and affective-happiness experimental inoculation conditions in order to examine the process of resistance. The results across all 3 conditions revealed a direct path in which inoculation treatments directly induced resistance to persuasive attacks. However, indirect paths to resistance varied across the 3 experimental conditions. Cognitive inoculation treatments contributed to receiver threat and counterarguing output, which, in turn, enhanced resistance. Thus, the cognitive inoculation treatments triggered a process that is consistent with McGuire's theoretical explanation for resistance. By contrast, both affective-anger and affective-happiness inoculation treatments relied more heavily on elicited emotional responses. Finally, the results indicated that greater receiver involvement was positively associated with experienced anger and, therefore, indirectly contributed to resistance, whereas greater receiver self-efficacy tended to dampen resistance.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00781.x,

This report argues that Powers et al.'s results are an artifact of the procedures employed, and presents additional evidence bearing on the relationship between cognitive complexity and general verbal abilities. In one study, conceptually independent assessments of cognitive complexity, loquacity, and writing speed were obtained from a group of college students. Cognitive complexity was found generally unrelated to both writing speed and loquacity. In a second set of studies, independent assessments of interpersonal cognitive complexity and two indices of general verbal abilities were obtained from three diverse populations (college students, mothers of young children, and grade-school children). Only low and generally nonsignificant relationships were found between cognitive complexity scores and the measures of verbal facility.

Three causal factors are identified as major determinants of the immigrant's communication patterns: language competence, acculturation motivation, and accessibility to host communication channels.

Using 9.6 million comments from The New York Times, we analyze whether the presence of uncivil and partisan terms affects how journalists and news users engage with comments. Results show that partisanship and incivility increase recommendations and the likelihood of receiving an abuse flag. Swearing increases the likelihood of a comment being rejected and reduces the chances of being highlighted as a NYT Pick.

We surveyed government health-care workers, whose advice networks mostly span organizational boundaries, across 1,849 state health agencies in Bihar, India. The collective attitudes of coworkers and advice network members influence health-care workers’ attitudes and perceptions of social norms toward four types of innovations. However, individuals’ decision-making authority moderates these relationships; advisors’ attitudes have a greater influence on ODMs, while perceptions of social norms only influence IDMs. Notably, heterogeneity of advisors’ and coworkers’ attitudes negatively influence IDMs’ evaluations of innovations but not ODMs’.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqaa018,

It identifies three verification practices, each based on a different notion of pragmatic trust: Reliance on ideologically close sources; skepticism toward individual sources while trusting media as institution; or institutional distrust and cynical disillusionment. Each practice is embedded in participants’ social environment, which both supplies information and helps negotiating appropriate verification practices.

The hypotheses were derived from prior literature on characteristics that differentiate the two leadership styles. A second purpose was to develop an instrument to be used in identifying autocratic and democratic leaders.

Twenty-one autocratic and 21 democratic adult, 4-H club leaders were identified by use of the paired comparison instrument developed in the study. These individuals led their club groups in 30 minute discussions of several prescribed questions. The discussions were taped, and the leaders' communication behaviors were content analyzed into the categories used to test the hypotheses.

Seven of the 12 hypotheses were confirmed; two approached sisllficance (p < .10), and three were not confirmed. The patterns of task-oriented communication were consistent with theoretic expectations.

The findings are discussed and interpreted as reflecting varying commitments to particular dimensions of group process on the part of autocratic and democratic group leaders. Moreover, it was suggested that confirmation of the hypotheses underscores the potential utility of the paired comparison instrument developed to identify autocratic and democratic leaders.",4.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1971.tb00921.x,

Missing in both Bakhtin's and Bateson's very different projects, however, are adequate theorizations of power. To address (the will to) power in ways that distinguish it from (the will to) control are Nietzsche's thoughts on genealogical philosophy, the will to power, relations of force, the eternal return, and the being of becoming, each of which speak to power in necessarily different ways. With those distinctions made, I specify several correspondences between speech genres and cybernetic minds as a theoretical context for Nietzsche's thinking. Given those correspondences, discursive formations can be theorized as self-organizing systems. Such systems incorporealize selves as dialogic subjectivities, and such selves are always already unfinalizable and an open totality. Dialogics can now be theorized as the praxis of mediating competing and contradictory discourses. The point of this theoretical work is to specify conversation practices that effect movement between dialectic and dialogic genres of speech communication.

The gender divide disappears when experience, skills, perceived competence, and intrinsic motivation are considered. Finally, a new racial gap emerged; whites are less likely than minorities to participate in the Web even after controlling for all other variables.

Major findings were supportive of the generalizability of the results observed in the previous studies. The interface of superior-subordinate relations and their impact on employee satisfaction were examined through perceptions of employees with regard to the MCS of upper management and the task behaviors (supervision and administration) of their immediate superiors. Results were supportive of the MCS conceptualization and indicated that MCS of immediate superior and MCS of upper management had their primary impact on different dimensions of employee satisfaction. Perceptions of superiors' task behaviors were found to have different impact on employees satisfaction for different organizational contexts. Variability in employee satisfaction predictable from individual employee differences and that predictable from superior-subordinate interface were found to have little overlap. It is recommended that both the individual differences (trait) and superior-subordinate interface (situational) approaches to the study of communication in organizational contexts be continued since the two generate independent predictions of unique variance.,1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1982.tb00663.x,

A model-based meta-analysis did not support the viewpoint that the pornography use–condomless sex association is spurious and confounded by sensation seeking. Instead, a path analysis suggested that pornography use energizes consumers' sensation seeking desires, in turn making them more likely to engage in condomless sex. Although the results indicated homogeneity of effect sizes across most contexts tested, the type of pornography content consumed moderated the pornography use–condomless sex relationship. Viewing pornography that does not show condoms was associated with an increased risk for having sex without condoms, whereas consuming pornography showing condoms was unrelated to sexual risk.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/hcr/hqaa005,

For that group, priming national identity also indirectly increases polarization via enhanced exposure to pro-attitudinal (i.e., anti-immigration) news. In one selection study, however, the prime’s polarizing effect is attenuated by increased exposure to counter-attitudinal (i.e., pro-immigration) news.

Nous étudions les manières par lesquelles les symboles pourraient être utilisés en communication de masse pour surmonter les préjugés envers les messages intra-groupes et extra-groupes. Nous explorons ces effets dans différents pays représentant des degrés divers d’ethnocentrisme (les attitudes à propos de son propre pays ou de son propre groupe) et d’animosité envers un pays particulier (les attitudes concernant un pays étranger spécifique, soit un groupe autre) chez les consommateurs. Nous avons sélectionné quatre pays présentant différents degrés d’ethnocentrisme et d’animosité envers les États-Unis.

Wir wählen vier Länder basierend auf verschiedenen Ausprägungen von Ethnozentrismus und Ablehnung gegenüber der USA. Unter Berücksichtigung einer Perspektive der sozialen Identität finden wir Hinweise auf Antwort-Asymmetrien bezüglich der In-Group-Präferenzen und Out-Group-Diskriminierung im Kontext von US-amerikanischen und einheimischen kulturellen Repräsentationen in Form von Symbolen und Marken.

Advances in latent variable modeling allow researchers to examine the multidimensional construct as a bifactor model, including a general factor of relational uncertainty and residualized factors of self, partner, and relationship uncertainty. This advance is theoretically consequential because RTT maintains the importance of distinctions among the facets of relational uncertainty, even while empirical evidence demonstrates considerable overlap among them. In two data sets (college sample, N = 513; married sample, N = 354), competing measurement models specified Relational Uncertainty Scale items as a unidimensional confirmatory factor model, 3-factor independent clusters confirmatory factor model, 3-factor exploratory structural equation model (ESEM), bifactor confirmatory factor model, and bifactor-ESEM. The bifactor-ESEM provided the best fit in both samples, and bifactor statistics clarified how variance from the scale is partitioned to yield essential unidimensionality for the general factor of relational uncertainty, controlling for its residualized factors.

Thus, such narratives are useful for gathering information about leaders and other important individuals who are evaluated in the community.

The heterogeneous images of 9 female protagonists set within the discourse of nation-building draws attention to issues of equality and empowerment. However, these representations also expose ruptures within feminism, and the project of nationalism as feminist sensibility is often criticized as a betrayal of the nation. Locating these tensions within feminist and historical contexts, I argue Home Affairs allegorically represents the rebirth or rebuilding of the nation. However, although Home Affairs can be read as representative of the nation that valorizes middle-class values, it simultaneously demonstrates the competing interests of national solidarity and free-market forces that perpetuate socioeconomic and educational segregation.

La (ré)invention de Home Affairs : Solidarité féministe et la nation sud-africaine

La série télévisée sud-africaine Home Affairs met en relief le défi que constitue la création d'une idée de nation unie et homogène. Les images hétérogènes de neuf personnages féminins, campées dans le discours de construction de la nation, attirent l'attention sur les questions d'égalité et d'autonomie. Toutefois, ces représentations exposent aussi des ruptures au sein même du féminisme. On reproche au projet nationaliste entendu comme sensibilité féministe de trahir la nation. Situant ces tensions dans leur contexte féministe et historique, je soutiens que Home Affairs représente une allégorie de la renaissance ou de la reconstruction de la nation. Cependant, bien que Home Affairs puisse être vue comme représentante de la nation qui valorise les valeurs de la classe moyenne, la série démontre aussi les intérêts rivaux des forces de solidarité nationale et du libre-marché, qui perpétuent la ségrégation socioéconomique et éducative.

Erfindung und Wiederentdeckung von Home Affairs: Feministische Solidarität und die südafrikanische Nation

Shelley-Jean Bradfield

Die südafrikanische Fernsehsendung Home Affairs (Heimatangelegenheiten) betont die Herausforderung, eine geeinte und homogene Vorstellung von Nation zu schaffen. Die heterogene Darstellung von neun Protagonistinnen, die in diesem Diskurs der Nationenbildung angelegt ist, lenkt die Aufmerksamkeit auf Themen wie Gleichheit und Empowerment, welche innerhalb der feministischen Praxis und Theorie elementar sind. Allerdings zeigen diese unterschiedlichen Repräsentationen auch Bruchstellen innerhalb und zwischen Feminismus und dem Projekt des Nationalismus auf, da eine feministische Sensibilität oft als Verrat der Nation kritisiert wird. Indem ich die Spannungen innerhalb der feministischen Diskussion und dem historischen Kontext von Südafrika herausarbeite, argumentiere ich, dass Home Affairs als Allegorie fungiert, um die Wiedergeburt oder Wiederherstellung einer Nation zu repräsentieren. Auch wenn das Projekt Home Affairs als Repräsentant einer Nation, die die Werte der Mittelschicht aufwertet, gelesen werden kann, zeigt es gleichzeitig die konkurrierenden Interessen von nationaler Solidarität und den Kräften des freien Marktes, welche ökonomische, bildungsbezogene und soziale Segregation aufrechterhalten.



(Re-)Inventando Los Asuntos de la Casa : La Solidaridad Feminista y la Nación de Sudáfrica

Shelley-Jean Bradfield Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47401, USA

Resumen

El programa de televisión “Los Asuntos de la Casa” producido en Sudáfrica, pone en primer plano el desafío de crear una noción unitaria y homogénea de la nación. La heterogeneidad de las imágenes de 9 protagonistas femeninos colocados dentro del discurso para armar la nación, llama la atención sobre los asuntos de igualdad y el fortalecimiento del poder. No obstante, estas representaciones exponen también las rupturas entre el feminismo, y el proyecto de nacionalismo como una sensibilidad feminista a menudo criticada como una traición a la nación. Localizando estas tensiones dentro de los contextos feministas e históricos, sostengo que “Los Asuntos de la Casa” representan alegóricamente el renacimiento o reconstrucción de la nación. No obstante, aunque “Los Asuntos de la Casa” pueden ser leídos como una representación que valoriza los valores de la clase media, simultáneamente demuestran los intereses competitivos de la solidaridad nacional y las fuerzas del mercado libre que perpetúan la segregación socioeconómica y educacional.",11.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1753-9137.2009.01054.x,

As an analytic of discourse’s capacity to gain and defend stakeholder rights in the public domain, property discourses provide a rigorous, language-centered approach to organizational conflict over environmental spaces by conceptualizing how material–symbolic tensions play out diachronically. I ground this theoretical terrain through a discourse analysis of a decade-long conflict over public lands in the southern part of the U.S. state of Utah. The case—Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument—constitutes a significant clash of politics between environmental preservation and extraction and especially what political regime ought to control roads accessing this 1.9-million-acre national monument. The analysis and interpretation indicate that property politics involve a complex interplay of symbolic and material forces among stakeholders.

We examine how actors mobilized their communicative resources in efforts to either bring ride-hailing or keep it away. For some advocates, ride-hailing technology was less important than Uber’s symbolic value of building Winnipeg’s image as an innovative city. Media coverage contrasted innovation and Uber with Winnipeg’s anxieties about being behind other cities and its taxi industry’s reputation as stuck in the past. These visions of Winnipeg’s future addressed an unspoken White, middle-class city dweller. While Winnipeg’s transportation industry was shaped by the socially located experiences of racialized immigrant men as taxi drivers and Indigenous women as passengers, these actors had less power to shape the imaginary.

It argues that the ways in which counterpublics set themselves against wider publics may be most productively explored by attending to the recognition and articulation of exclusion through alternative discourse norms and practices.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2000.tb00201.x,

E-mail surveys gathered quantitative and qualitative insights from survivors and non-survivors. Generally, organizations that invested more resources (money, people, and time) in their Web sites in 1997 were more likely to have surviving sites three years later. Technological expertise, as measured by the level of feature-richness at sites, had relatively little impact on survival. Sites created by individuals were least likely to survive while education and government sites were most likely to survive. Respondents indicated that organizational commitment to Web-based communication was an important factor in long-term survival of sites. Sites with more visitors in 1997 were more likely to survive than those with fewer visitors, but many respondents pointed out the importance of targeting rather than sheer numbers in measuring the Web site audience.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2001.tb00123.x,

Consistent with the Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE), when the group level of self-identity was rendered salient in an intergroup encounter, uniform virtual appearance of CMC partners triggered depersonalization and subsequent conformity behavior. By contrast, when the personal dimension of the self was salient, standardized representation tended to reduce conformity.

Claims of the Internet's potential range from a promise to revolutionize the fundamental way health care is delivered to a tool for empowering patients through enhanced interaction with providers (Rice, 2001). Even though a great amount of attention has been given to e-health activity, the preponderance of publications to date has focused on the Internet as a source of health information. However important this form of e-health is, this type of service simply does not face the same constraints that must be addressed by those actually delivering health care services or tightly regulated pharmaceutical products. In this paper, we examine e-health by focusing explicitly on the delivery of health care products and services. Our examination of e-health activity is guided by two broad research questions. First, we ask what the potential is for the development of online health care services by examining its potential in major health care service and product sectors. Second, based upon case studies of two online health service firms, we seek to understand the emerging strategies of firms that are attempting to enter the health care market with an entirely online approach. Our examination of current e-health trends, as well as our two case studies, demonstrates the tremendous potential for health-related commercial activity on the Internet. However, our examination of the barriers facing ehealth from the US health system also pointed out the almost insurmountable challenges. We therefore conclude that a “click and mortar” model may perhaps be the optimal strategy for e-health.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2001.tb00129.x,

After a brief review of the key concepts of information theory, the thinking of psychiatrists, psychologists and information theorists with regard to the phenomenon of ambiguity tolerance is integrated. It is shown that by utilizing concepts and approaches gleaned from both fields it is possible to predict an individual's responses to ambiguity. These include shielding oneself from information by withdrawal, by making formal and informal commitments to social institutions, by subscribing to an ideology, and by utilizing linguistic devices (e.g., oversimplification in the form of stereotypes and clichés, literalness and two-valued thinking) as information shields. Further, it is possible to predict the consequences of these responses to ambiguity, including self-containment, inhibition, affective frigidity, redundancy-dependence, avoidance of intimacy and personal rigidity. The origins of low ambiguity tolerance in family settings and under conditions of psychological stress are discussed.

Widespread adoption of the Internet for news reading may change that situation. The World Wide Web provides audiences with substantially more control over the news selection process than they enjoyed with the traditional media.

The research setting is citizen participation in a city government's policy-making process on smoking in public places. Participation as communicative action is evaluated by the extent to which citizens accept the validity of what policy makers say and by whether citizens feel that they can raise concerns about a proposed policy in unrestricted communication environments. Findings indicate that citizens feel participatory in a decision-making process if they recognize policy makers' validity claims and perceive uncoerced speech conditions. Communicative action variables exercise significant predictability on a dependent variable indicating policy legitimacy.,1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01508.x,

The communication in two groups was categorized by means of the Systems Information Processing Analysis (SIPA) category system. Messages were coded on four dimensions of information-processing: (1) source of information, (2) time orientation, (3) evolution of information, and (4) reduction of equivocality. The sequence of coded messages was then compared with a first-order Markov chain model. The results indicate the communication data from the groups are first-order; the groups are nonhomogeneous; stereotypy (predictability of patterns) is low to moderately high across the four dimensions; patterns in the evolution of information dimension are stationary over time. Patterns in the three other SIPA dimensions are nonstationary (time dependent) and suggest nonlinear changes. The information-processing patterns in the groups indicate that most information was spontaneously generated within the groups; the predominate time orientation was “present”; the form of message generally was either neutral opinion or new information; and moderate to moderately high uncertainty existed over time.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1979.tb00643.x,

Effects of Moderator Visibility on Bystander Behavior,https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/26/5/284/6335779,10.1093/jcmc/zmab007,,"This study evaluates whether increasing information visibility around the identity of a moderator influences bystanders’ likelihood to flag subsequent unmoderated harassing comments. In a 2-day preregistered experiment conducted in a realistic social media simulation, participants encountered ambiguous or unambiguous harassment comments, which were ostensibly flagged by either other users, an automated system (AI), or an unidentified moderation source. The results reveal that visibility of a content moderation source inhibited participants’ flagging of a subsequent unmoderated harassment comment, presumably because their efforts were seen as dispensable, compared to when the moderation source was unknown. On the contrary, there was an indirect effect of other users versus AI as moderation source on subsequent flagging through changes in perceived social norms. Overall, this research shows that the effects of moderation transparency are complex, as increasing visibility of a content moderator may inadvertently inhibit bystander intervention.

This study examines the effects of flagging unmoderated offensive posts on social media, and how this changes the users’ subsequent behavior. We examined users’ reactions to the flagging of these posts by other users, an automated system, or an unspecified process to determine whether this affects the users’ ensuing behavior. A 2-day experiment on a simulated social media site showed that the visibility of the “flagger” impacts how users perceive social norms and think about the accountability for their own online actions. The results showed that the visibility of the person/system that flagged the material generally deterred subsequent flagging. The analysis also shows that the effect was stronger when the users thought that it was other users, and not an automated system, that had flagged the online harassment.",2.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmab007,

Anticipated future interaction with another is presumed to increase persons'motivation to reduce their uncertainty. Prior to conversation, for example, observers engage in higher levels of information-seeking when they expect to meet the target. However, examination of subjects’ use of question-asking strategies suggested this effect does not extend to ongoing interaction. Instead, highest levels of mutual interrogation occurred at moderate levels of anticipated future interaction, in dyads required to negotiate a second encounter. The extent to which interlocutors control subsequent interaction has not been previously identified as a determinant of either uncertainty or uncertainty reduction. Such increased question-asking may be a function of actors’ desire to avoid negative conversational outcomes, a desire that becomes especially salient when actors are allowed to select their social partners.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1987.tb00128.x,

Using behavioral data from seven local broadcast news sites, we assess how the device used and referral site affect whether people click on links to more news. We experimentally test four components of the presentation of links on news sites: content, labels, location on page, and images. Findings show that accessing news via social media and mobile devices reduces clicks relative to other paths and devices. Further, link presentation matters; for instance, links to Related content yielded more clicks than Popular content for those coming from search or a news homepage on PCs. We advance a conditional explanation of motivated news exposure and identify practical insights for news organizations.

We test four components of the presentation of links on news sites: content, labels, location on page, and images. We find that accessing news via social media and mobile devices leads to fewer clicks compared to other pathways to news. We also find that how links are presented matters. For example, the highest click-through rate we observed was when people using a PC and a search engine to visit a news site saw Related links at the end of a page accompanied by images and labeled in a way that appealed to social motivations. These conditional pathways are important for understanding news exposure and can provide practical insights for news organizations.",2.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jcmc/zmab009,

By combining network analysis with qualitative analysis, we identified three central strategies of video activism: movement building through documentation, discursive controversy generation, and personal branding practices. These strategies are firmly supported by the affordances of YouTube and by the way in which the platform enables the building of varying scales of media presence. Consequently, our findings highlight the increasingly common practice of microcelebrity branding in online political communication. This notion demonstrates the affinities between fragmented and contingently mobilized anti-immigration movements and the personalizing and performance-oriented logics of social media presence, in particular when explored from a post-movement perspective. In the algorithmic environment of YouTube, microcelebrity is a political and a platform-specific genre that occupies the post-movement political space by generating sustainable algorithmic visibility.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqz051,

This new integrated model illuminates how these five features of digitalization affect relationships among elites, traditional media, and individuals, and suggests research on whether they flatten and democratize hierarchies of information control and power or entrench dominant structures.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqx019,

Understood as typified communicative practices that formalize and express shared values, rituals offer a productive path to categorize popular genres of content and trace the values they convey. Integrating theoretical literature on rituals with empirical studies of social media genres, we develop a typology of 16 rituals that express diverse values, ranging from respect and responsibility to materialism and pleasure. Furthermore, we show that rituals embed different notions of good communication, as reflected in the values of authenticity, persuasion, affiliation, and demonstration.

This conceptual separation can also limit groups’ abilities to see the potential for dialogue while they are engaged in discussion. This essay argues that personal storytelling can be a bridge between dialogue and discussion by inviting group members to experience dialogic moments in the midst of deliberative conversation. Stories invite dialogic moments because they help group members negotiate the tension of self–other. This negotiation occurs because through telling and responding to personal stories, group members craft their identities and take on others’ perspectives. This argument is illustrated through the analysis of a storytelling interaction that occurred in an online deliberative group discussing how to rebuild the former World Trade Center site after its destruction on September 11, 2001.

Revisiting their connection to Shakur through the biopic functioned as intimate heritage, as fans used a variety of mediated forms to reflect on their lives through the symbolic record of Shakur’s life. Therefore, the movie’s content was secondary to the ways a mediated discussion of the artist facilitated fans’ self-reflection.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ccc/tcy032,

In turn, we tested whether perceived credibility of both the journalist and the scientist resulted in a belief change about media effects research. Results indicate that the conflict frame (i.e., balance norm) decreased perceived credibility of the scientist and in some conditions decreased credibility of the journalist.

Pushing the boundaries of media, the theory integrates various notions of presence at a distance: telepresence in telecommunications and computer-mediated communication, liveness in broadcasting and on the Internet, and the epistolary presence of antiquity. Theoretically, it adopts a social constructivist approach to long-term communication history, with an emphasis on technological breakdowns. The core discussion addresses three criteria for a historical, comparative analysis of mediated presence: dissemination versus dialogue, transmission-reception time lags, and levels of disembodiment. Refuting axiological and technology-centered views of history, the article concludes that increased technological options for presence at a distance have remained essentially ambivalent for users who vacillate between the need for distance and the search for connection.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtz020,

The longitudinal data show that heavy use of the Internet is associated with reductions in the likelihood of visiting family or friends on a randomly selected day. Cross-sectional analyses show high correlations between the frequency with which respondents communicate with specific family members by visits, phone calls and email, suggesting that communication in one medium stimulates the others.

Instead, and drawing upon Walter Benjamin’s concept of wish image, the author argues that this invocational pattern reflects a general desire for a one-to-one correspondence between being and doing—here understood as a manifestation of the ur-historical longing for absolution. Because this desire is ambivalent, the angel has historically been invoked to symbolize wishes as divergent as fascism’s ideal gender relations and radical utopia’s equality.

This so-called “replication crisis” has spurred calls for open science practices, which aim to increase the reproducibility, replicability, and generalizability of findings. Communication research is subject to many of the same challenges that have caused low replicability in other fields. As a result, we propose an agenda for adopting open science practices in Communication, which includes the following seven suggestions: (1) publish materials, data, and code; (2) preregister studies and submit registered reports; (3) conduct replications; (4) collaborate; (5) foster open science skills; (6) implement Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines; and (7) incentivize open science practices. Although in our agenda we focus mostly on quantitative research, we also reflect on open science practices relevant to qualitative research.

The first is to do with formal procedures and invites us to “measure the gap” between the ideal and the actual.

When exposed to messages about abolishing Social Security, participants exposed to episodic frames were significantly more likely to endorse message-consistent attitudes than participants exposed to a thematic frame. In mediation analyses, an episodic frame featuring a counterstereotypical exemplar increased endorsement of individual responsibility for retirement planning, which then led to more negative attitudes toward Social Security. These effects did not occur with a stereotypical exemplar in an episodic frame. The same mediated pathway influenced attitudes toward older adults in a more complex manner. Results provide support for individual responsibility attributions as a mediating mechanism underlying the effects of certain episodic frames.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/hcre.12045,

Contrary to expectations, conservatives were less likely to be uncivil as the proportion of ingroup members (i.e., other conservatives) in the discussion increased and less sensitive to incivility directed at outgroup members (i.e., liberals) than were nonconservatives. Audience members had more extreme evaluations of uncivil comments made by partisans than nonpartisans.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jcc4.12191,

Insisting on the sociality of anything amounts to focusing on the relations that sustain its existence and identity, while insisting on its materiality consists of highlighting what this thing is made of, which also leads us to acknowledge its relationality. This relational ontology invites us to analyze the multiple ways by which communication constitutes our world. It shows, in particular, how human beings should also be understood as media through which other beings communicate, whether the latter are policies, ideologies, passions, situations, organizations, other people, or ecosystems.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqx014,

Merleau-Ponty described language as a gesture, made possible by the fact that we are bodies in a physical world. Language does not envelop or clothe thought; ideas materialize as embodied language, whether spoken or written. If silence is, as I argue here, as like speech as it is different, perhaps silence, too, can be a gesture.

Plan failure, however, requires alteration or even production of an original plan. Although researchers have relied exclusively on output (e.g., response latency, memory tests) to draw inferences about planning processes, it is possible to observe cognitive processes more directly by measuring cortical responses. In the present study, electrical activity was monitored in the region of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during verbal planning. Results indicated that (a) electrical activity while planning under conditions that permitted enactment of verbal plans that required no modification was significantly lower than during planning in the initial trial but, (b) electrical activity while planning under conditions in which previous efforts failed was significantly higher than during planning in the initial trial.
