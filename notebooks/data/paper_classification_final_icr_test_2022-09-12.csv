This article deals with a major question flowing from the aforementioned task: Is it possible to reframe the past as a “cosmopolitan memory” for the purpose of promoting solidarity and peace? The article provides preliminary evidence of what can be called a “cosmopolitan turn” in collective memory construction, together with suggestions regarding the associated research lexicon. Through analysis of the obituaries published in the elite Israeli daily Haaretz, it illustrates some of the discursive strategies to be used to reframe the past as a cosmopolitan memory.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2011.01397.x

However, citizen exemplars differ regarding their level of personal involvement in the issue they talk about. Affected exemplars have some kind of personal experience with an issue (e.g. ill people) whereas unaffected citizens, as ordinary “people from the street,” do not. We examine for the first time how exemplars’ personal involvement moderates their effects on recipients’ perceptions of public opinion and personal attitudes. The results show that compared to unaffected exemplars, affected exemplars weaken effects on public opinion perceptions. In contrast, the moderating role of exemplar involvement for attitudinal effects was limited.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/hcr/hqx007

The media literacy model proffered here attempts to show the hierarchical relationship of four levels: (a) the basic aesthetic image elements and their aesthetic fields, (b) how they are structured for specific purposes, how we perceive them and how they affect us, and (d) how they fit into the various intellectual and cultural frameworks for media analysis.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02739.x

Two main factors are identified: the distribution of political power and changes in the media market. To test these assumptions, a content analysis of the news coverage of 5 national election campaigns in Denmark was conducted (4,592 news stories). First, the more unevenly political power is distributed, the more visible the government is. Second, results suggest a trade-off between the incumbency bonus and the coverage of nonsubstantive issues. Third, changes in news coverage seem to be more driven by changes in the political system than by changes in the media market.

In this meta-analysis, we analyzed the relationship of IE and five outcomes relevant for democracies. Including 106 distinct samples with more than 100,000 respondents, we observed positive cross-sectional relationships between IE and news use, political knowledge, political participation, expressive engagement, and political discussion. These effects shrink substantially but remain significant for panel studies. While we found a stronger relationship with knowledge for experiments compared to surveys, the relationship between IE and discussion and participation was not significant for experiments. Overall, findings suggest that IE matters, but its effects are smaller and more nuanced than previously thought. Also, the effects of IE are strongest when there is congruence between the exposure setting and the outcome setting.

At three, the most important communicative functions were to verbally master information about the environment (interpretative function) and to express one's needs and ideas (relational function). Interpretative strategies included labelling and elaboration of detail, which enabled children to explore their environment through verbal means. Relational strategies reflected the child's egocentrism since 75% of those strategies were self-emphasizing strategies. At four, a major developmental shift occurred, with the projective function becoming most important, followed by the relational function. Within the projective function, imaginating strategies enabled children to create new roles and contexts for their play. Both imaginating and relational strategies incorporated increasingly adaptive communication directed toward others. Generally it was found that females appeared to develop language strategies (utilized by both sexes) earlier than males, and achieved a more advanced level of cognitive complexity and communicative adaptability in their relational and projective strategies.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1983.tb00687.x

Results suggest that relational closeness is independently associated with each type of media multiplexity.

The study was carried out as part of the INTERLINGUA project conducted by the UOC's Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3). Its main goal is to ascertain the linguistic characteristics of the e-mail register in the newsgroups in order to assess their implications for the creation of an online machine translation environment. The results shed empirical light on the relevance of characteristics of the e-mail register, the impact of language contact and interference, and their implications for the use of machine translation for CMC data in order to facilitate cross-linguistic communication on the Internet.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2003.tb00360.x

The results of the survey revealed a significant relationship between exposure to televised social aggression and increased social aggression at school, but only for girls and not for boys. Although this relationship was dependent on the sex of the child, the study is the first to provide evidence that viewing social aggression on television is related to an increased tendency for elementary school children to perpetrate such behaviors in the classroom.

We surveyed 100 Latino dyads about the adolescents’ pursuit and mothers’ inference of adolescent language brokering interaction goals. In line with sociometer theory, adolescents had higher self-esteem when they pursued goals related to respecting the mother and English speaker, and when mothers inferred adolescents pursued goals related to respect. Adolescents reported the least self-deprecation when they reported high pursuit of respect goals and mothers simultaneously inferred high adolescent respect goals. Adolescents with better Spanish abilities were more likely to pursue most goals, and mothers were more likely to infer all adolescent goals when adolescents brokered more frequently.

However, it is still unclear how to assess the dynamic nature of media effects methodologically and analytically. Building on recent research on media effects and developments in statistical modeling, I present a methodological framework to provide a detailed analysis of media effect dynamics. To do so, I describe general patterns for the appearance and the duration of media effects and present statistical approaches to analyze them. Using artificial data, I illustrate how these statistical approaches can be applied to longitudinal data and show how they behave across different data scenarios. Further, extensions, limitations, and the theoretical contribution of the framework to the field of media effects research are discussed. In sum, the presented framework can be used to test various communication theories and can be combined with many research designs in order to identify patterns in the appearance and duration of media effects.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqac013

On the basis of a theoretical integration of entertainment theory with theories of motivated information processing, we suggest that entertainment consumption can either be driven by hedonic, escapist motivations that are associated with a superficial mode of information processing, or by eudaimonic, truth-seeking motivations that prompt more elaborate forms of information processing. Results of two experiments indicate that eudaimonic forms of emotional involvement (characterized by negative valence, moderate arousal, and feeling moved) stimulated reflective thoughts about politically relevant content, issue interest, and information seeking. This pattern was consistent across two types of entertainment stimuli (fictional films and soft news) and two types of affect manipulations (moving film music and moving exemplars).",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jcom.12095

(b) The 3 types of interactivity exhibited a greater presence of public affairs content during the period of heightened political activity than during its routine counterpart. (c) As the period of heightened political activity unfolded, consumers' propensity to click on, e-mail, and comment about public affairs stories increased.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2011.01418.x

The study reported here is the first to collect a combination of survey and behavioral data with the cooperation of a major virtual world operator. In the current study, 7,000 players of the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) EverQuest 2 were surveyed about their offline characteristics, their motivations and their physical and mental health. These self-report data were then combined with data on participants’ actual in-game play behaviors, as collected by the game operator. Most of the results defy common stereotypes in surprising and interesting ways and have implications for communication theory and for future investigations of games.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.00428.x

Raising such countervailing issues as women’s supposed complicity in sexual harassment and the drawbacks of digital activism in comparison with legal action, Liu’s article marked a crucial moment in the public awareness and discussion of #MeToo and digital activism in China in 2018. By analyzing the critical responses to Liu’s argumentations, we examined the discursive impact of these critical efforts to destabilize Liu’s hegemonic reading of the sexual harassment culture in China. We show how Liu’s critics offered a compelling defense of #MeToo, deconstructed enduring gendered myths, and had a significant impact in terms of reclaiming feminism in China. We argue further that the critics’ intellectual and deliberative efforts exemplify China’s local struggles in the global #MeToo movement and feminist activism.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/joc/jqaa033

I then examine how communication works in communalistic communities.

Previous analyses have shown that, when expecting to meet with a target, persons recall comparatively more information about the target. Those analyses, however, have provided no indication as to the type of information persons recall nor the range of recall across an action sequence. Moreover, there is no present understanding of the recall performance of persons who observe a target prior to being induced to expect interaction, although such a situation may be common in social contexts. This analysis sought to address these issues. Subjects viewed a videotaped interaction between a female (target) and a male.
