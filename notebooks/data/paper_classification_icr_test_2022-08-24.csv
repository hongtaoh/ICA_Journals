We hypothesize that perceptions of a communicator's competence mediate the effects of conflict strategies on the relational outcomes measured by trust, control mutuality, intimacy, and satisfaction. The components of competence were specific and general appropriateness, effectiveness, and global competence; these were included in LISREL analyses to investigate How the variables conflict, competence, and relational outcomes were linked. Participants reported on their partners’ conflict strategies, their own perceptions of the partner's competence, and relational variables. The results reveal that integrative strategies were positively linked to competence, whereas distributive and avoidant strategies were negatively linked to competence. The results support the view that competence perceptions mediate the link between conflict messages and relational outcomes.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1989.tb00202.x

Participants were placed in an initial mood and led to anticipate different activities after the waiting period. The upcoming activities were either dynamic or lengthy (arousal) and associated with either pleasure or performance (valence), resulting in a 2 × 2 design. During an ostensible waiting period, participants listened to choices of popular music at their will in a computer-aided procedure. This music taken from the Top 30 charts had been evaluated in a pretest for energy and joyfulness as musical qualities in order to create sets of musical selections that were either low or high in these qualities. In the experiment proper, selective exposure to energetic-joyful music as dependent measure was unobtrusively recorded via software. Results regarding self-exposure across time show that patterns of music listening differ with initial mood and anticipation, lending support to mood adjustment hypotheses. Mood management processes occurred in the beginning of the waiting period, whereas mood adjustment purposes set in toward the anticipated activity.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02588.x

But the problem of endogeneity applies equally to reinforcement and attitude-change research. Our critics also argue that exposure to alternative news outlets and entertainment programming is exogenous and has the potential to shape political attitudes. We respond that the political content of these programs, while surely promoting other desirable political outcomes, is too sporadic to produce large-scale message effects of the sort described by the classic persuasion paradigm.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01471.x

Drawing on recent anthropological scholarship and our own cross-cultural comparative case study of United States and Chinese students' accounts of learning Anglo-American public speaking, we claim that, from an ethnographic perspective, a communication resource has value insofar as speakers interpret it as an object of desire due to its function as a means to other valued entities or focal values in the context of relevant social processes.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ct/qtz042

Through an analysis of framing technique in C.Akerman’s (2000) The Captive, this essay argues that Metz’s identification of spectatorship’s nonphenomenal element allows us to understand not only how the cinema lures, captures our desire, but also how it can potentially reorient our relation to the visual field by causing spectatorship’s failure, at least in what we might call its bourgeois mode.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00287.x

Social power was manipulated to create 144 face-to-face dyadic interactions between individuals of high versus low power and 64 neutral power interactions. Particular configurations of personality traits (high self-monitoring, Machiavellianism and leadership, and low self-consciousness, impression management and agreeableness), combined with a low-power role, led to an increased likelihood of linguistic style accommodation. Further, greater accommodation by low-power individuals positively influenced perceptions of subjective rapport and attractiveness.

Results for the first year indicated that inoculation promotes resistance to smoking initiation but only among adolescents of low self-esteem. This report follows up the first-year results in an effort to assess the permanence of the initial effects. The results during the second year revealed main effects for inoculation on attitudes, suggesting modest persistence for the initial pretreatments, and a weak interaction effect in the fall, which dissipated by spring. In addition, the pattern of results suggests that if resistance approaches are to have a chance of success in smoking prevention they must target young adolescents at the point of transition from primary (elementary) to secondary (middle or junior high) school. Beyond this pivotal juncture, adolescents’attitudes opposing smoking quickly deteriorate, therefore rendering the resistance paradigm inappropriate.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1994.tb00329.x

Results indicated that older communicators in dissatisfying conversations were characterized as being underaccommodative and negatively expressive and as stereotyping young people. In response, young people frequently characterized themselves as reluctant accommodators. In addition, dissatisfying conversations were judged as more “intergroup” than those that were satisfying. Suggested improvements for dissatisfying conversations often were placed primarily on the shoulders of the older counterparts. In contrast, in satisfying conversations, older interactants were construed as supportive, telling interesting stories, astereotypical of older people, and positively expressive.

Most readily associated with the discursive alignments between competitive gaming and/as sport, the active camera mode used by esports competitors and “shoutcasters” facilitates analyzing the highly kinetic action of team-based combat in first-person shooters and multiplayer online battle arenas. Here, we draw from microanalyses of audio-visual recordings taken as individual participants spectated a Dota 2 match.

Parental understanding of the child's self-concept was associated with frequent and open communication, high parent–child relationship satisfaction, and a strong child self-concept.

The structure of hyperlink interconnectivity suggests that the ruling Uri party affiliated blogs are key in the blog network. For example, the blogs tied with the Uri party have a higher centrality and are more densely connected. Network diagrams also suggest that the top blogs are polarized by party. However, some blogs are located at the center of the Uri and GNP clusters and are connected to both camps. In other words, there are a number of citizen blogs that link to both the Uri and GNP members, because their political identities are not completely shaped but also remain between 2 different ideologies.

Using 2-wave U.S. panel survey data, this study sheds light over 2 sets of motivations people may have for engaging in political conversation: civic-oriented and social-oriented goals; and their effects over civic participation. Using structural equation modeling, results suggest that both civic and social motivations are positive predictors of frequency of political discussion, and indirectly associated with civic engagement. From a theoretical perspective, these findings cast political talk as a more complex phenomenon than what deliberative theory suggests, and point to social motivations as an additional path to civic life.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/hcre.12086

By documenting changes in discourse occurring between 1998 and 2004 over the labeling of music file-sharing as deviant, it seeks to unveil how power machinates in establishing the parameters between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors In doing so, Foucault's work on power is used as a starting point for investigating strategies employed by corporate elites and file-sharers in order to shift the balance of power. The contest between discourses seeking to restrict or enhance the capacities of free agents in online environments is evidenced in the mutability of a legal discourse seeking to normalize online life. Until now, how the online “music pirates” should be disciplined is in a state of flux where certain developments appear to be favoring corporate interests and others, the interests of music file-sharers. In this struggle, online discourses seeking to curtail freedoms and opportunities advanced by corporate elites and online discourses of freedom purported by music file-sharers, are reversible. This reversibility suggests that online, some offline discourses would be a hindrance and as such, their agents could resist the dominant online discourse by engaging in creative behaviors. Likewise, traversing offline producer-led discourses with innovative and creative actions online could lead to consumers' autonomy. This paper concludes that the significance of these online struggles is embedded not only in their outcomes but also in the processes leading to them. Thus, while attempts to curb these online practices and freedoms persist, changes to a discourse guiding trading conditions between the Recording Industry and end-users have been noted, constituting a victory for the latter.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00293.x

Mobile sessions are constructed and mined to uncover sequential characteristics and patterns in mobile phone use. Mobile trajectories are analyzed to examine intraindividual change and interindividual differences on mobile re-engagement as indicators of behavioral dynamics in mobile phone use. The study provides empirical support for and expands the boundaries of existing theories about combinatorial use of information and communication technologies (ICTs).

Its role is not as straightforward as one might suppose, as exemplified by a case study of Native American powwow rhetoric. In this study, epideictic speakers typify and construct reported speech, using both analytic and formulaic modes to elaborate on ceremonial messages. I suggest that the role of reported speech is twofold: to validate authority and to construct value. The formulae in particular are useful rhetorical devices in reifying “equality” in powwow social structure. Epideictic rhetoric employing reported speech does not merely perform the significance of a given society; it constructs and manipulates interaction in order to minimize differential identities. More importantly, reported speech is a particular triadic discourse that parallels the transformation phase of ritual, known as liminality. This essay asserts that liminality is at the heart of all epideictic rhetoric and is thus crucial for understanding ritual discourse such as reported speech.",1.0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2004.tb00314.x
