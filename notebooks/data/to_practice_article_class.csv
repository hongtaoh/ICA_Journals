In this article we test that argument through a content analysis of television characters in all occupations across 30 seasons. The findings reaffirm that television stigmatizes the occupation of business, independently of economic factors. These results pose a challenge to mass communications theory that interprets popular culture as a source of social control.",1.0

Although studied extensively in entertainment, it has been largely ignored in political communication. The results of two experimental studies with U.S. adults (n = 210 and n = 630) suggest that political speeches can evoke elevation responses, and that such an elevation response is not affected by the political party of the speaker. An elevating response was associated with greater positivity toward politics and the speaker (Studies 1 and 2), as well as increased perceived closeness with one’s own party and the opposing party (Study 2). Elevation was also associated with lower political cynicism. These outcomes further predicted both intentions to participate in the political process and information-seeking behavior. In a time when U.S. politics seem especially divided, elevation may represent one possible avenue for encouraging political discourse and participation.",1.0

Missing in both Bakhtin's and Bateson's very different projects, however, are adequate theorizations of power. To address (the will to) power in ways that distinguish it from (the will to) control are Nietzsche's thoughts on genealogical philosophy, the will to power, relations of force, the eternal return, and the being of becoming, each of which speak to power in necessarily different ways. With those distinctions made, I specify several correspondences between speech genres and cybernetic minds as a theoretical context for Nietzsche's thinking. Given those correspondences, discursive formations can be theorized as self-organizing systems. Such systems incorporealize selves as dialogic subjectivities, and such selves are always already unfinalizable and an open totality. Dialogics can now be theorized as the praxis of mediating competing and contradictory discourses. The point of this theoretical work is to specify conversation practices that effect movement between dialectic and dialogic genres of speech communication. By way of extending these lines of thinking, I sketch some theoretical ideas for a dialogics of conversation.",1.0

The Friedmans’ market public narrowly construes conceptions of knowledge as arising from direct experience and communication as information exchange. Knowledge as direct experience supports the putative universality of self-interest and the sovereignty of individuals as exclusive public actors. Presuming a uniformity of understanding, communication as information exchange dissociates advocates from messages and contributes to the Friedmans’ view of persuasion as an individualistic mode of interaction. Connecting the Friedmans’ model to contemporary scholarly critiques of neoliberalism, I argue that this model portends significant anti-democratic consequences. Citing former U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ campaign to reorganize public education as a market, I illustrate the contemporary circulation of this model.",1.0

Common forms of misinformation—fake news, rumors, and conspiracy theories—while dysfunctional for communicating property information—information about the state and operation of things—can actually be valuable for communicating character information—information about the motivations of social agents. It is argued that narratives containing “false facts” can effectively portray a speaker's theory of another individual's character. Thus, such narratives are useful for gathering information about leaders and other important individuals who are evaluated in the community. After deriving the theory, TIF is used to derive propositions predicting the empirical conditions under which misinformation will be accepted, tolerated or promoted. The implications of the theory for addressing the normative problem of misinformation are also discussed.",1.0

In Study I, the variables of personalness and valence were manipulated through the use of prototypical disclosure statements with subjects blocked by sex. Subjects were asked to use a scale indicating phases of relationship development to rate when they would likely disclose statements. The analysis revealed significant main effects for all three factors: personal-ness, valence, and gender, as well as a significant interaction between personalness and valence. In Study II, personalness and valence were again manipulated, along with blocking for sex. The variable of disclosure recipient (target) was manipulated by asking subjects to separately indicate whether or not they would disclose each statement to five targets: stranger, acquaintance, parent, friend, and spouse. The analysis revealed significant main effects for three factors: personalness, valence, and target. All possible interactions of these variables were also significant. Due to the many consistencies between the findings of these two studies and the many highly significant interactions, it was concluded that a multidimensional approach to the study of self-disclosure is both justified and required.",1.0

In response to survey questions, Americans often profess an interest in current events news, but assessments of citizens' political knowledge often find them wanting. Unfortunately, the limitations of previously available research methods have left researchers with an incomplete understanding of news audiences and their exposure patterns. Widespread adoption of the Internet for news reading may change that situation. The World Wide Web provides audiences with substantially more control over the news selection process than they enjoyed with the traditional media. With that enhanced control, it appears online readers are particularly likely to pursue their own interests, and they are less likely to follow the cues of news editors and producers. The present study takes advantage of this attribute of online news presentation to examine the topics people select at Web-based news outlets. In general, online news audiences choose to read public affairs news less frequently than survey research suggests. This result has implications for the long-term health of democratic nations.",1.0

It is argued that students of information theory and of psychiatry and psychology can work together to elucidate the phenomenon of ambiguity tolerance and to begin approaching a “theory” of disordered communication arising from low levels of ambiguity tolerance.

After a brief review of the key concepts of information theory, the thinking of psychiatrists, psychologists and information theorists with regard to the phenomenon of ambiguity tolerance is integrated. It is shown that by utilizing concepts and approaches gleaned from both fields it is possible to predict an individual's responses to ambiguity. These include shielding oneself from information by withdrawal, by making formal and informal commitments to social institutions, by subscribing to an ideology, and by utilizing linguistic devices (e.g., oversimplification in the form of stereotypes and clichés, literalness and two-valued thinking) as information shields. Further, it is possible to predict the consequences of these responses to ambiguity, including self-containment, inhibition, affective frigidity, redundancy-dependence, avoidance of intimacy and personal rigidity. The origins of low ambiguity tolerance in family settings and under conditions of psychological stress are discussed. Finally, it is shown that by utilizing knowledge and concepts from both fields, it is possible to sketch broad approaches to therapeutic treatment of disordered communication arising from low levels of ambiguity tolerance.",2.0

Moreover, we analyzed the impact of personalization, investigating whether effects would differ for health, news, and commercial websites. Results from an online experiment using a representative Dutch sample (N = 1,131) supported the privacy calculus, revealing that it was stable across contexts.

The present study was designed to measure physiological desensitizatian (heart rate) and to investigate the relationships between this measure and other cognitive, affective, and attitudinal components of the desensitization process. Subjects were either exposed to a two-hour videotape portraying violence against women or to exciting, nonviolent material (i.e., auto races, nonviolent sex). Following this, all subjects were exposed to two brief clips of violence perpetrated by a man against a women. During these clips, all subjects’ heart rates were monitored. Afterwards mood reactions and perceptions of the perpetrators and victims depicted in the dependent measure clips were measured. The results indicated that heart rates for subjects exposed to the violent videotape were lower during the final 90 seconds of each violent dependent measure film clip than controls. Although the violence-viewing subjects experienced no change in moods, control subjects experienced significant increases in hostility, anxiety, and depression during the dependent measure clips. Subjects in the violence-viewing condition attributed less injury to the victims but greater responsibility to the perpetrators in the dependent measure clips, compared to control subjects.

Those with high self-esteem exhibited stronger third-person effect than those with low self-esteem.

But do perceptions of social media actually influence citizens’ online and offline political behaviors as suggested by the so-called “Slacktivism hypothesis?” In the present study, we undertake a more careful examination of this question by testing a theoretical model in which perceiving participation on social media as an easy or impactful means of engaging in politics encourages political expression on social media, which in turn increases offline political participation. Using panel survey data collected during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we show that positive perceptions of social media indirectly increase offline political participation, through the influence of political expression on social media. However, we find no such positive indirect effects for those with politically diverse networks or for younger people.

This paper summarizes the contributions of the self-disclosure literature for an understanding of self-disclosing communication. Although this literature is extensive, a considerable portion of it is irrelevant from a communication perspective. Conceptualizations of self-disclosure differ in important ways, making it difficult to compare studies. Further, much of the research studied self-disclosure as a personality trait rather than a process of communication or analyzed exchanges of messages in terms of a linear model of communication. The present study explicates a conceptualization of self-disclosure as an invitation to share experience and communication as an interpersonal transaction. Five generalizations about self-disclosing communication consistent with these conceptualizations are drawn from the literature.

In this paper, we argue that the dynamics of political expression on social media can influence not only political behavior, but also citizens’ more fundamental political self-concepts. Specifically, political expression on social media can entail a public commitment to a political self-presentation, which may lead individuals to perceive themselves as politically active, interested, efficacious, and knowledgeable. Analyzing panel survey data from the 2016 U.S. election, we find that political expression on social media increases users’ motivations to present themselves as politically active on social media. Political self-presentation motivations are, in turn, positively associated with strengthened dimensions of political self-concepts (i.e., political interest, political self-efficacy, and perceived participation). Findings emphasize the role of expression in shaping political self-concepts, and further hint that this relationship may depend on whether the expressive behavior constitutes a clear, public commitment to a political self-presentation.",1.0

In this model, communication is no longer described as one of the component(s) of collaboration; communication is elevated to the essence of collaboration.

This paper presents a statistical appraisal of the determinants of on-line customer penetration for a cross-sectional sample of the major incumbent banks in Western Europe for the combination of the years 1988 to 2000. “Pull” factors play a large role in explaining customer conversion to Internet banking, yet bank-specific factors (or “push” factors) are not marginal. Among others, banks with traditionally high cost-effectiveness and that already offer wide private ATM coverage for their customers are also the ones which have already started to migrate a larger proportion of their customer base on-line. Interestingly, among all “push” factors analyzed, cost-effectiveness emerges as the largest leverage effect on customer conversion. Finally, a cluster analysis supplements the regression results along the axes of “pull” and “push”, and identifies a set of early movers and laggards among the banks in our sample. Generally speaking, those first-movers already exhibit stronger off-line profitability than laggards, which may indicate that the on-line marketplace may reproduce performance off-line (i.e., currently successful banks have nothing to fear from aggressive start-ups).",1.0

These forms of attention—to the banal details of coexistence—and attunement—to the strange sounds of everyday life in postindustrial societies—provoke a mode of “ecological thought.” As this essay argues, thinking ecologically engenders a meaningful mode of political engagement that invites reflection on the consequences of impure relations.",1.0

Message indexes were created to reflect the scope of the audience they addressed. Macro-scopic messages were formal, dealt with political issues, and either did not mention technology or mentioned mass media. These messages resembled a letter to a newspaper editor. Mezzoscopic messages were positive and avoided political issues. They congratulated NBC as a team for their work on the technology series and tended to mention computers. Micro-scopic messages stood out for their authors' high perception of interactivity. These messages mentioned computer technology more than any other group and appear similar to face-to-face communication in many ways. Results are discussed in terms of how the relationship between media users' perceived sense of interactivity and the scope of the audience they address are related to message style and content.",1.0

Dynamism, trust, clarity, mood, and criticism emerged as important underlying dimensions of peer feedback. Additionally, this study explored the communicator style in giving feedback. Significant communicative differences across group members were found in their manner of giving feedback. Effectiveness of feedback was significantly related to the feedback's dynamism and with a verbally assertive style. This study appears to demonstrate that both feedback content and form influence judgments of feedback effectiveness.",1.0

However, one can classify these texts differently with equal plausibility by attending to aspects of the social psychology and economic conditions of current science that are rarely considered by most rhetoricians of science and attending to 2 significant rhetorical requirements of successful scientific texts—programmaticality and interestingness—that have gone unnoticed by rhetoricians of science to date. Given this equality of categorization plausibility, traditional genre theories are contradicted. More significantly, through the author's provision of a reflexive analysis, pragmatist genre theory is supported and extended. Thus, this article contributes to genre theory and the rhetoric of science.",1.0

Given that traditional media in the Arab world generally are subject to strict government control, the participatory features that accompany the new online media should make these sources even more attractive to users. However, comments posted by readers of online media in the Arab world are still subject to some monitoring and content regulation. This study explores the potential of online media in the Arab world to foster civic engagement. The online source selected for study is www.alarabiya.net, the official website for the popular TV station Al Arabiya in Dubai. Ethnographic observation and analysis of the content of articles published during the Iraq War on Al Arabiya’s site and the responses they received show that Arabs not only challenged the views of the Al Arabiya site about the war, but they also offered their own versions of the truth.",1.0
