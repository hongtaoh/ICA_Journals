## Paper classification ICR

First, with `2022-08-20-new-cat-issueurl.ipynb`, we get the list of all categories with associated frequencies. Then in this the dataset, we (Kristen, Jeff and I) reclassified categories: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E2dgJCpv5FrxKv41QZuNsv7MjJs3IcBxFbZze_5rnjU/edit#gid=2060805888

After we classified these categories as either "to exclude" or not, I put the raw result into `data/interim/cat_class_raw.csv`

- `data/interim/icr/paper_classification_icr_test_2022-08-27.csv` is the randomly selected 100 rows to test paper classification intercoder reliability. This dataset is generated by `2022-08-27-GET-100-random-papers-to-classify-types-for-ICR.ipynb`. 

- This is the raw result: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1POuzorD6B2r8uO9gdpBgt1U1ZksJhbCTzaolnAKQpmU/edit#gid=1585704198

Krippendorff alpha: 0.831

- `paper_cla_ica_compa_results_2022-08-29.csv` is the aggregated results. This result is computed by `2022-08-29-calculate-paper-cla-icr.ipynb`

- Then, We did all the classification here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uslTqfe269jf0KHJ8E70XHru2jag8y-iiRRb94HQA9s/edit#gid=349722970, which is created by `2022-08-29-randomly-split-ica-paper-df-for-paper-classification.ipynb`

- We tested final icr here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KvPvm5DWAP9ndPbB4yfEWyet5WIu0rfKsqM_FL2kbP8/edit?usp=sharing
  - This is created by `2022-09-12-GET-100-random-papers-to-classify-types-for-final-ICR.ipynb`
  - Result: `2022-09-13-calculate-paper-classification-final-icr.ipynb`. 
  - Final ICR: .79

<!-- ## with type

- With `2022-09-14-get-paper-and-author-with-type.ipynb`, I add `type` to ica paper df and author data with pred. I also outputed research paper df and research author with pred.  -->

## race and gender 

- With `2022-09-14-get-100-names-for-initial-gender-race-icr.ipynb`, I randomly selected 100 names for initial icr for race and gender. 

- This is where they coded: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZgDutpqsO23PqssScUaACHdWuu32mzO1SmNOkbsq-jA/edit#gid=112686513. And there is the data for Matthew: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VS7iTtfS640PA56o8DnPh3DJm4Dx5UJfubvkbXd7IwI/edit#gid=0

- I calculated race and gender ICR in `2022-09-19-calculate-initial-gender-icr.ipynb`. The ICR is 0.94. 

- Here is the aggregated results for initial gender coding: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZgDutpqsO23PqssScUaACHdWuu32mzO1SmNOkbsq-jA/edit#gid=1431889162

<!-- ### Post ICR

- With `2022-12-02-get-100-names-for-final-gender-race-icr.ipynb`, I obtained 100 names for final ICR for gender and race. Resulting data is `data/interim/icr/2022-12-02-race-gender-post-icr-100names.csv`

- This is where they coded:  -->

### Redo Race

- Gender is okay but we need to redo race. Now I used `2022-09-20-get-100-names-for-race-icr.ipynb` to get another 100 random names for race ICR. Here is where we coded the race: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fe_w078ZxqOV8HxmjuqJav5ff-PM4bElJr9CgSwZHHw/edit?usp=sharing

- I calculated the ICR here: `2022-09-23-calculate-initial-race-icr.ipynb`. The initial ICR is 0.91. 

- Here is the aggregated result: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fe_w078ZxqOV8HxmjuqJav5ff-PM4bElJr9CgSwZHHw/edit#gid=1729958890

## ACTUAL CODING

### author affiliation

With `2022-09-16-split-aff-task.ipynb` I split the dataset. Here is where we coded: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DA7EZ1SmvdaMihPzNqcp1aHmZ_N6PQpxB5YUjI_jNoY/edit#gid=393854720

### Gender and Race

I did it here: `2022-09-23-split-race-gender-task.ipynb`. There datasets are deposited in `data/interim/gender_race_coding_task`

Note that I found one person who uses anonymous name: https://academic.oup.com/ct/article/8/4/381/4201775. I then updated the script of `get_paper_and_author_with_type.py` in the workflow. Now this issue is solved.
